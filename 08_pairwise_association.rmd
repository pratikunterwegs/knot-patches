# Pairwise associations in relation to traits

## Read in patch data and overlaps

```{r}
# to handle data
library(readr)
library(scales)
library(tidyr); library(tibble)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)

# to plot
library(ggplot2)
library(scico)

# functions
ci <- function(x){qnorm(0.975)*sd(x, na.rm = T)/sqrt((length(x)))}
```

```{r}
# read in patch data
data_patches <- read_csv("data/data2018/data_2018_patch_summary_has_patches.csv") %>% 
  mutate(uid = as.character(1:nrow(.)))

# read in overlap data
data <- read_csv("data/data2018/data_spatio_temporal_overlap_2018.csv")
```

### Read in trait data

```{r}
# make nodes data -- this the individual identities
# add individual data to patch data
data_id <- readxl::read_excel("data/data2018/Biometrics_2018-2019.xlsx") %>% 
  filter(str_detect(`TAG NR`, "[a-zA-Z]+", negate = TRUE))

# a function for gizzard mass
get_gizzard_mass <- function(x, y) {-1.09 + (3.78*(x*y))}

# add gizzard mass
data_id <- mutate(data_id,
                  gizzard_mass = get_gizzard_mass(SH1, SW1))

# rename columns and drop ids without mass and gizzard mass
data_id <- data_id %>% 
  select(id = `TAG NR`, 
         wing = WING, mass = MASS, 
         gizzard_mass) %>% 
  distinct(id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  drop_na(gizzard_mass)

# add some exploration scores and tag info
data_behav <- read_csv("data/data2018/2018-19-all_exploration_scores.csv") %>% 
  filter(Exp == "F01")
data_tag <- read_csv("data/data2018/tag_info.csv") %>% 
  mutate(id = as.character(Toa_Tag))

# join all scores
data_id <- left_join(data_id, data_tag,
                     by = c("id")) %>% 
  left_join(data_behav, by = "FB")

# remove ids with no exploration
data_id <- mutate(data_id,
                  behav = Mean) %>% 
  # drop_na(behav) %>% 
  select(id, mass, gizzard_mass, behav)
```

### What is the empirical distribution of differences in gizzard mass?

### Filter out small patches

Each fix corresponds to 30s time.

```{r}
data_patches <- filter(data_patches,
                       nfixes > 3)

data <- data %>% 
  filter(patch_i_unique_id %in% data_patches$uid,
         patch_j_unique_id %in% data_patches$uid)
```

### Link patches with overlaps

```{r}
# convert to character
data <- mutate_at(data, vars(contains("patch")), as.character)
data <- left_join(data, data_patches,
                  by = c("patch_i_unique_id" = "uid")) %>% 
  left_join(data_patches,
            by = c("patch_j_unique_id" = "uid"))
```

### Count pairwise overlaps

```{r}
# first clip data into 3 sections with lims at 0, 55
data_summary <- data %>%
  mutate(tide_number = tide_number.x,
         waterlevel = waterlevel_start.x,
         tide_stage = case_when(waterlevel <= 0 ~ "low",
                                # between(waterlevel, 0, 55) ~ "medium",
                                waterlevel > 0 ~ "high",
                                T ~ NA_character_)) %>% 
  
  # count as well as add strength in terms of space and time
  group_by(id.x, id.y, tide_number, tide_stage) %>% 
  summarise(n_associations = length(spatial_overlap_area),
            tot_overlap_space = sum(spatial_overlap_area),
            tot_overlap_time = sum(temporal_overlap_seconds)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
# link trait values
data_summary <- mutate_at(data_summary,
                          vars(matches("id")),
                          as.character)
data_summary <- left_join(data_summary,
                          data_id,
                          by = c("id.x" = "id")) %>% 
  left_join(data_id,
            by = c("id.y" = "id"))

# get difference in traits
data_summary <- data_summary %>% 
  mutate(diff_gizzard = abs(gizzard_mass.x - gizzard_mass.y),
         diff_gizzard_round = plyr::round_any(diff_gizzard, 0.5),
         diff_behav = abs(behav.x - behav.y),
         tide_stage = forcats::as_factor(tide_stage),
         tide_stage = fct_relevel(tide_stage,
                                  "low", "high")) %>% 
  drop_na(diff_gizzard)
```

### Assign unique pair ids

```{r}
# count the number of data in each class
data_summary %>% 
  count(diff_gizzard_round)

# count the difference in gizzards per pairwise association
data_summary <- data_summary %>% 
  group_by(id.x, id.y) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(uid_pair = seq_len(nrow(.)))

# then unnest
data_summary <- unnest(data_summary,
                       col = "data")
```

## Save data to file for analyses

```{r}
write_csv(data_summary, path = "data/data_pairwise_comparisons.csv")
```

## Read data for statistical analyses

```{r}
read_csv(data_summary, path = "data/data_pairwise_comparisons.csv")
```

### Subsample for even coverage

Small gizzard mass differences are over-represented as expected from a population with normally distributed traits. This requires subsampling based on difference bins.

```{r}
# filter for differences above 5 and subsample as many
# as supported
data_subsample <- data_summary %>% 
  filter(diff_gizzard_round <= 3) %>% 
  group_by(tide_stage, diff_gizzard_round) %>% 
  nest() %>%
  mutate(data = map(data, function(x) x[1:1480,])) # this is hardcoded

# unnest
data_subsample <- unnest(data_subsample, cols = "data")
```

## Statistical modelling of number of associations

### Fit a GLMM for number of associations

Difference in gizzard mass and behaviour score are predictors.

```{r}
# run a single canonical model
library(lmerTest)
model_n_assoc_full <- glmer(n_associations ~ diff_gizzard * tide_stage +
                         diff_behav * tide_stage +
                         (1|tide_number) +
                         (1|uid_pair),
                       data = data_subsample,
                       family = "poisson")

# run an alternative model with only behaviour
model_n_assoc_behav_only <- glmer(n_associations ~ 
                                 diff_behav * tide_stage +
                                 (1|tide_number) +
                                 (1|uid_pair),
                               data = data_subsample,
                               family = "poisson")

# an alternative model with only gizzard mass
model_n_assoc_gizzard_only <- glmer(n_associations ~ 
                                 diff_gizzard * tide_stage +
                                 (1|tide_number) +
                                 (1|uid_pair),
                               data = data_subsample,
                               family = "poisson")
```

### AIC comparison

Compare the AIC weights after looking at the model summaries.

```{r}
summary(model_n_assoc_full)

summary(model_n_assoc_behav_only)

summary(model_n_assoc_gizzard_only)
```

It seems that differences in behaviour as well as gizzard mass are each sufficient sufficient to explain the observed number of overlaps. Examine the AIC scores.

```{r}
# get aic difference
map_dbl(list(behaviour_only = model_n_assoc_behav_only, 
         gizzard_only = model_n_assoc_gizzard_only, 
         gizzard_and_behav = model_n_assoc_full),
    AIC)
```

With similar AIC scores and R<sup>2</sup> values, we select the reduced model by the parsimony principle, and write the model output to file.

```{r}
model_output = capture.output(map(list(behaviour_only = model_n_assoc_behav_only, 
                                       gizzard_only = model_n_assoc_gizzard_only, 
                                       gizzard_and_behav = model_n_assoc_full),
                                  summary))

# save it to file
write_lines(x = model_output, path = "results/model_n_assoc.txt")
```

Read in the model and print summary.

```{r}
cat(read_lines("results/model_n_assoc.txt"), sep = "\n")
```


## Statistical modelling of spatial overlap

### GLMM for spatial overlap

```{r}
# run a model with overlap as the response
library(lmerTest)
model_sp_overlap_full <- lmer(tot_overlap_space ~ diff_gizzard * tide_stage +
                         diff_behav * tide_stage +
                         (1|tide_number) +
                         (1|uid_pair),
                       data = data_subsample)

# run an alternative model with only behaviour
model_sp_overlap_behav_only <- lmer(tot_overlap_space ~ 
                                 diff_behav * tide_stage +
                                 (1|tide_number) +
                                 (1|uid_pair),
                               data = data_subsample)

# an alternative model with only gizzard mass
model_sp_overlap_gizzard_only <- lmer(tot_overlap_space ~ 
                                 diff_gizzard * tide_stage +
                                 (1|tide_number) +
                                 (1|uid_pair),
                               data = data_subsample)
```

### AIC comparison

Compare the AIC weights after looking at the model summaries.

```{r}
summary(model_sp_overlap_full)

summary(model_sp_overlap_behav_only)

summary(model_sp_overlap_gizzard_only)
```

It seems that differences in behaviour are sufficient in this case to explain the observed extent of overlaps. Examine the AIC scores.

```{r}
# get aic difference
map_dbl(list(behaviour_only = model_sp_overlap_behav_only, 
         gizzard_only = model_sp_overlap_gizzard_only, 
         gizzard_and_behav = model_sp_overlap_full),
    AIC)
```

```{r}
model_output = capture.output(map(list(behaviour_only = model_sp_overlap_behav_only, 
                                       gizzard_only = model_sp_overlap_gizzard_only, 
                                       gizzard_and_behav = model_sp_overlap_full),
                                  summary))

# save it to file
write_lines(x = model_output, path = "results/model_sp_overlap.txt")
```

Read in the model summary and write.

```{r}
cat(read_lines("results/model_sp_overlap.txt"), sep = "\n")
