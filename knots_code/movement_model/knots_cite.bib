abstract = {The Wadden Sea is a shallow coastal region, with a large area of sedimentary tidal flats that extends from The Netherlands to Denmark and has been declared a site of international importance in the Dutch and German parts (Ramsar status and UNESCO World Heritage Site). Benthic macrofauna are central to the ecosystem functioning of this area, as they recycle nutrients, decompose organic matter and are an important food source for many secondary consumers, like fish and waterbirds. Due to the environmental gradients characteristic of estuarine systems, it is expected that changes in assemblage composition will be observed across the physical and environmental gradients of the Wadden Sea. First, we explored the spatial variation in assemblage composition of benthic macrofauna across the intertidal part of the Dutch Wadden Sea using 3years of biomass data. Then, we identified the relative importance of six environmental variables for explaining and predicting changes in assemblage composition across the intertidal areas of the Wadden Sea using generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM). In accordance with the environmental gradients across this system, the biomass contributed by a few common species differed from west to east and were distinct in the Dollard. In the west, bivalves Mya arenaria, Cerastoderma edule and Ensis directus contributed a relatively large and equal share of the total biomass, whereas C. edule contributed the sole largest share of the total biomass towards the east. The polychaete Alitta succinea became a large share of the total biomass in the upper Ems and in the Dollard estuary, but contributed little elsewhere. Similar to the observed differences in species composition, the spatial patterns in assemblage composition, as predicted by the GDM models, identified the Dollard as distinct and that the prevalence of assemblage types in the west differed to the east. Median grain size, followed by microphytobenthic biomass, and exposure time were the most important variables describing differences in assemblage composition. That the Wadden Sea forms a heterogeneous landscape where assemblage composition varies across multiple gradients has repercussions for management and monitoring.},

In spite of this, no one seems to have considered ambient temperature as limiting landscape choices in elephants. We recorded hourly landscape use in free-ranging elephants using GPS collars. We also placed temperature data loggers in each of the landscapes, to obtain corresponding ambient temperatures for each hour. Our results suggest that elephants may select landscapes based on the rate at which temperatures changed and also for shade. We suggest that these selected variables provide a thermal benefit to individuals. As such, we propose that landscape use in elephants may be constrained by their thermal physiological requirements as well as other resources such as food and water. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We evaluated the initial 12 months of vegetation index product availability from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Earth Observing System-Terra platform. Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations.},

abstract = {In the context of climate change and species invasions, range shifts increasingly gain attention because the rates at which they occur in the Anthropocene induce rapid changes in biological assemblages. During range shifts, species experience multiple selection pressures. For poleward expansions in particular, it is difficult to interpret observed evolutionary dynamics because of the joint action of evolutionary processes related to spatial selection and to adaptation toward local climatic conditions. To disentangle the effects of these two processes, we integrated stochastic modeling and data from a common garden experiment, using the spider mite Tetranychus urticae as a model species. By linking the empirical data with those derived form a highly parameterized individual-based model, we infer that both spatial selection and local adaptation contributed to the observed latitudinal life-history divergence. Spatial selection best described variation in dispersal behavior, while variation in development was best explained by adaptation to the local climate. Divergence in life-history traits in species shifting poleward could consequently be jointly determined by contemporary evolutionary dynamics resulting from adaptation to the environmental gradient and from spatial selection. The integration of modeling with common garden experiments provides a powerful tool to study the contribution of these evolutionary processes on life-history evolution during range expansion.},

My conclusion ({\S}4) will stress that multicausality is at work in that resistance to analogy, the cultural factor put forward in {\S}3 being the main explanation.

abstract = {A technique for using patch giving up densities to investigate habitat preferences, preda-tion risk, and interspecific competitive relationships is theoretically analyzed and empirically investigated. Giving up densities, the density of resources within a patch at which an individual ceases foraging, provide considerably more information than simply the amount of resources harvested. The giving up density of a forager, which is behaving optimally, should correspond to a harvest rate that just balances the metabolic costs of foraging, the predation cost of foraging, and the missed opportunity cost of not engaging in alternative activities. In addition, changes in giving up densities in response to climatic factors, predation risk, and missed opportunities can be used to test the model and to examine the consistency of the foragers' behavior. The technique was applied to a community of four Arizonan granivorous rodents (Perognathus amplus, Dipodomys merriami, Ammospermophilus harrisii, and Spermophilus tere-ticaudus). Aluminum trays filled with 3 grams of millet seeds mixed into 3 liters of sifted soil provided resource patches. The seeds remaining following a night or day of foraging were used to determine the giving up density, and footprints in the sifted sand indicated the identity of the forager. Giving up densities consistently differed in response to forager species, microhabitat (bush versus open), date, and station. The data also provide useful information regarding the relative foraging efficiencies and microhabitat preferences of the coexisting rodent species.},

abstract = {Endothermy is significant in vertebrate evolution because it changes the relations between animals and their environment. How endothermy has evolved in archosaurs (birds, crocodiles and dinosaurs) is controversial especially because birds do not possess brown adipose tissue, the specialized endothermic tissue of mammals. Internal heat production is facilitated by increased oxidative metabolic capacity, accompanied by the uncoupling of aerobic metabolism from energy (ATP) production. Here we show that the transition from an ectothermic to an endothermic metabolic state in developing chicken embryos occurs by the interaction between increased basal ATP demand (Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity and gene expression), increased oxidative capacity and increased uncoupling of mitochondria; this process is controlled by thyroid hormone via its effect on PGC1alpha and adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) gene expression. Mitochondria become more uncoupled during development, but unlike in mammals, avian uncoupling protein (avUCP) does not uncouple electron transport from oxidative phosphorylation and therefore plays no role in heat production. Instead, ANT is the principal uncoupling protein in birds. The relationship between oxidative capacity and uncoupling indicates that there is a continuum of phenotypes that fall between the extremes of selection for increased heat production and increased aerobic activity, whereas increased cellular ATP demand is a prerequisite for increased oxidative capacity.},

We start by briefly discussing patterns of variation in behaviour that have been documented in natural populations. In the main part of the paper we discuss models for personality differences that (i) explain animal personalities as adaptive behavioural responses to differences in state, (ii) investigate how feedbacks between state and behaviour can stabilize initial differences among individuals and (iii) provide adaptive explanations for animal personalities that are not based on state differences. Throughout, we focus on two basic questions. First, what is the basic conceptual idea underlying the model? Second, what are the key assumptions and predictions of the model? We conclude by discussing empirical features of personalities that have not yet been addressed by formal modelling. While this paper is primarily intended to guide empiricists through current adaptive theory, thereby stimulating empirical tests of these models, we hope it also inspires theoreticians to address aspects of personalities that have received little attention up to now.},

abstract = {The identification of patterns in life-history strategies across the tree of life is essential to our prediction of population persistence, extinction, and diversification. Plants exhibit a wide range of patterns of longevity, growth, and reproduction, but the general determinants of this enormous variation in life history are poorly understood. We use demographic data from 418 plant species in the wild, from annual herbs to supercentennial trees, to examine how growth form, habitat, and phylogenetic relationships structure plant life histories and to develop a framework to predict population performance. We show that 55{\%} of the variation in plant life-history strategies is adequately characterized using two independent axes: the fast-slow continuum, including fast-growing, short-lived plant species at one end and slow-growing, long-lived species at the other, and a reproductive strategy axis, with highly reproductive, iteroparous species at one extreme and poorly reproductive, semelparous plants with frequent shrinkage at the other. Our findings remain consistent across major habitats and are minimally affected by plant growth form and phylogenetic ancestry, suggesting that the relative independence of the fast-slow and reproduction strategy axes is general in the plant kingdom. Our findings have similarities with how life-history strategies are structured in mammals, birds, and reptiles. The position of plant species populations in the 2D space produced by both axes predicts their rate of recovery from disturbances and population growth rate. This life-history framework may complement trait-based frameworks on leaf and wood economics; together these frameworks may allow prediction of responses of plants to anthropogenic disturbances and changing environments.},

abstract = {Movement of individual organisms, one of the most fundamental features of life on Earth, is a crucial component of almost any ecological and evolutionary process, including major problems associated with habitat fragmentation, climate change, biological invasions, and the spread of pests and diseases. The rich variety of movement modes seen among microorganisms, plants, and animals has fascinated mankind since time immemorial. The prophet Jeremiah (7th century B.C.), for instance, described the temporal consistency in migratory patterns of birds, and Aristotle (4th century B.C.) searched for common features unifying animal movements (see ref. 1).{\$}\backslashbackslash{\$}n{\$}\backslashbackslash{\$}nModern movement research, however, is characterized by a broad range of specialized scientific approaches, each developed to explore a different type of movement carried out by a specific group of organisms ( 2). Beyond this separation across movement types and taxonomic (or functional) groups, movement research divides into four different “paradigms,” the random, biomechanical, cognitive, and optimality approaches ( 1), which are loosely linked to each other. Although movement research is extensive and is growing rapidly ( 2), specialization has its cost: measurement and analysis tools are repeatedly reinvented, and lessons learned from one line of research often do not affect others. Most importantly, we lacked a cohesive framework that would serve as a unifying theme for developing a general theory of organism movement.{\$}\backslashbackslash{\$}n{\$}\backslashbackslash{\$}nThis Special Feature lays the foundation for “movement ecology” as a unifying paradigm for studying all types of movement involving all organisms. The term movement ecology has been used occasionally in the literature [as of August 2008, a search of movement ecology in the title, abstract, or keywords in the ISI Web of Knowledge database ( http://apps.isiknowledge.com ) yielded 18 publications, the first of which was published in 1976], chiefly referring to ecological interactions associated with animal movement. However, the movement ecology concept underlying this Special Feature},

abstract = {Some mammals indigenous to desert environments, such as camels, cope with high heat load by tolerating an increase in body temperature (T (b)) during the hot day, and by dissipating excess heat during the cooler night hours, i.e., heterothermy. Because diurnal heat storage mechanisms should be favoured by large body size, we investigated whether this response also exists in Asian elephants when exposed to warm environmental conditions of their natural habitat. We compared daily cycles of intestinal T (b) of 11 adult Asian elephants living under natural ambient temperatures (T (a)) in Thailand (mean T (a) {\~{}} 30°C) and in 6 Asian elephants exposed to cooler conditions (mean T (a) {\~{}} 21°C) in Germany. Elephants in Thailand had mean daily ranges of T (b) oscillations (1.15°C) that were significantly larger than in animals kept in Germany (0.51°C). This was due to both increased maximum T (b) during the day and decreased minimum T (b) at late night. Elephant's minimum T (b) lowered daily as T (a) increased and hence entered the day with a thermal reserve for additional heat storage, very similar to arid-zone ungulates. We conclude that these responses show all characteristics of heterothermy, and that this thermoregulatory strategy is not restricted to desert mammals, but is also employed by Asian elephants.},

abstract = {Foraging by mammals is a complex suite of behaviors that can entail high energetic costs associated with supporting basal metabolism, locomotion and the digestion of prey. To determine the contribution of these various costs in a free-ranging marine mammal, we measured the post-dive oxygen consumption of adult Weddell seals (N=9) performing foraging and non-foraging dives from an isolated ice hole in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. Dives were classified according to behavior as monitored by an attached video-data logging system (recording activity, time, depth, velocity and stroking). We found that recovery oxygen consumption showed a biphasic relationship with dive duration that corresponded to the onset of plasma lactate accumulation at approximately 23 min. Locomotor costs for diving Weddell seals increased linearly with the number of strokes taken according to the relationship: locomotor cost = –3.78+0.04 x stroke number (r2=0.74, N=90 dives), where locomotor cost is in ml O2 kg–1. Foraging dives in which seals ingested Pleuragramma antarcticum resulted in a 44.7{\%} increase in recovery oxygen consumption compared to non-foraging dives, which we attributed to the digestion and warming of prey. The results show that the energy expended in digestion for a free-ranging marine mammal are additive to locomotor and basal costs. By accounting for each of these costs and monitoring stroking mechanics, it is possible to estimate the aerobic cost of diving in free-ranging seals where cryptic behavior and remote locations prevent direct energetic measurements.},

abstract = {In predator-free large herbivore populations, where density-dependent feedbacks occur at the limit where forage resources can no longer support the population, environmental catastrophes may play a significant role in population regulation. The potential role of fire as a stochastic mass-mortality event limiting these populations is poorly understood, so too the behavioural and physiological responses of the affected animals to this type of large disturbance event. During September 2005, a wildfire resulted in mortality of 29 (18{\%} population mortality) and injury to 18, African elephants in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. We examined movement and herd association patterns of six GPS-collared breeding herds, and evaluated population physiological response through faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (stress) levels. We investigated population size, structure and projected growth rates using a simulation model. After an initial flight response post-fire, severely injured breeding herds reduced daily displacement with increased daily variability, reduced home range size, spent more time in non-tourist areas and associated less with other herds. Uninjured, or less severely injured, breeding herds also shifted into non-tourist areas post-fire, but in contrast, increased displacement rate (both mean and variability), did not adjust home range size and formed larger herds post-fire. Adult cow stress hormone levels increased significantly post-fire, whereas juvenile and adult bull stress levels did not change significantly. Most mortality occurred to the juvenile age class causing a change in post-fire population age structure. Projected population growth rate remained unchanged at 6.5{\%} p.a., and at current fecundity levels, the population would reach its previous level three to four years post-fire. The natural mortality patterns seen in elephant populations during stochastic events, such as droughts, follows that of the classic mortality pattern seen in predator-free large ungulate populations, i.e. mainly involving juveniles. Fire therefore functions in a similar manner to other environmental catastrophes and may be a natural mechanism contributing to population limitation. Welfare concerns of arson fires, burning during “hot-fire” conditions and the conservation implications of fire suppression (i.e. removal of a potential contributing factor to natural population regulation) should be integrated into fire management strategies for conservation areas.},

abstract = {The search phase is a critical component of foraging behavior, affecting interspecific competition and community dynamics. Nevertheless, factors determining interspecific variation in search efficiency are still poorly understood. We studied differences in search efficiency between the lappet-faced vulture (Torgos tracheliotus; LFV) and the white-backed vulture (Gyps africanus; WBV) foraging on spatiotemporally unpredictable carcasses in Etosha National Park, Namibia. We used experimental food supply and high-resolution GPS tracking of free-ranging vultures to quantify search efficiency and elucidate the factors underlying the observed interspecific differences using a biased correlated random walk simulation model bootstrapped with the GPS tracking data. We found that LFV's search efficiency was higher than WBV's in both first-to-find, first-to-land, and per-individual-finding rate measures. Modifying species-specific traits in the simulation model allows us to assess the relative role of each factor in LFV's higher efficiency. Interspecific differences in morphology (through the effect on perceptual range and motion ability) and searchers' spatial dispersion (due to different roost arrangements) are in correspondence with the empirically observed advantage of LFV over WBV searchers, whereas differences in other aspects of the movement patterns appear to play a minor role. Our results provide mechanistic explanations for interspecific variation in search efficiency for species using similar resources and foraging modes.},

abstract = {Four young adult elephant bulls aged 21-23 in the Letsatsing Game Reserve, a private reserve near Pilanesbury NP in South Africa, were the subjects of this study focused on body temperature. The elephant were trained to carry people were engaged in short term daily programmes for tourist or public education groups and normally spend the remainder of the daytime moving freely through the 800 ha reserve. The internal body temperature was recorded by ingested data loggers (i-Button DS19221, Maxim Integrated Products, California, USA) 'set to record the temperature every five minute intervals to determine the 24 hour pattern of body temperature as well as the magnitude and frequency of short-term variation in body temperature'. The data loggers were given to the elephants by placing it by hand towards the back of the tongue and suppyling a constant stream of water from a hosepipe until th e data logger was swallowed. The data loggers were retrieved from the faeces. Mean body temperature over the July 2006-November 2007 study period was about 36.4 +/-0.03 degrees C and mean daily amplitude was about 1.2 +/- 0.04 degrees C. Body temperature appeared to be largely independent from the environmenal temperature which ranges form -1 to 52 degrees C. Large short term changes of $\backslash$textgreater0.3 degrees seemed to be associated with ingestion of water, but either swimming or spashing caused a drop in temperature on a consistent basis. It appeared the elephants engaged in these latter behaviours for thermal comfort or pleasure rather than lowering body temperature. Higher than average body temperature was not associted with higher that average ear flapping, but the rate flappng increased with the increase in enviromnental temperature. 'I conclude that despite their large size, African elephtants, with access to water, regulate their body temperture within narrow limits, with a 24 hour pattern similar to that seen in other medium- to large-sized mammals.},

abstract = {Physical barriers, such as rivers and roads, constrain the movement of animals, usually by preventing access to adjacent habitats and impeding dispersal. Fences are artificial barriers that are commonly used as a conservation tool to intentionally restrict movements of animals to within protected reserves. However, the potential edge-effect of fences on the behaviour of animals within reserves is poorly understood. We examined the effect of fences on the movement patterns of African elephant (Loxodonta africana), an ecosystem modifier, in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. We used linear and non-linear models to determine the relationship between minimum distance from fence and seasonal daily net displacement of six GPS-collared female elephant. Elephant movement patterns were best explained by a piecewise regression that showed a strong negative relationship between minimum distance from fence and daily net displacement up to a “breakpoint” distance of 2551m in the dry season and 3829m in the wet season. The effect of the fence dissipated beyond this distance in both seasons. The increased tortuosity in movement patterns of elephant in the central area of the reserve suggested that they used this area more intensively for foraging compared to the peripheral area, as confirmed by differences in habitat selection. This occurs despite there being no difference in habitat composition between these areas. The decreased use of areas near the fence and more intensive foraging in the central areas constitute an important edge-effect of fences. Since elephant are ecosystem engineers, such edge-effects could potentially cascade throughout the reserve, adversely altering ecologically processes, particularly in reserves with a high edge-to-area ratio.},

Recent research now suggests that an individual's behaviour, once considered to be plastic, may be more predictable than previously thought. Here, we take advantage of the large number of studies that have estimated the repeatability of various behaviours to evaluate whether there is good evidence for consistent individual differences in behaviour and to answer some outstanding questions about possible factors that can influence repeatability. Specifically, we use meta-analysis to ask whether different types of behaviours were more repeatable than others, and if repeatability estimates depended on taxa, sex, age, field versus laboratory, the number of measures and the interval between measures. Some of the overall patterns that were revealed by this analysis were that repeatability estimates were higher in the field compared to the laboratory and repeatability was higher when the interval between observations was short. Mate preference behaviour was one of the best studied but least repeatable behaviours. Our findings prompt new insights into the relative flexibility of different types of behaviour and offer suggestions for the design and analysis of future research.},

abstract = {In an era of rapid climate change, there is a pressing need to understand how organisms will cope with faster and less predictable variation in environmental conditions. Here we develop a unifying model that predicts evolutionary responses to environmentally driven fluctuating selection and use this theoretical framework to explore the potential consequences of altered environmental cycles. We first show that the parameter space determined by different combinations of predictability and timescale of environmental variation is partitioned into distinct regions where a single mode of response (reversible phenotypic plasticity, irreversible phenotypic plasticity, bet-hedging, or adaptive tracking) has a clear selective advantage over all others. We then demonstrate that, although significant environmental changes within these regions can be accommodated by evolution, most changes that involve transitions between regions result in rapid population collapse and often extinction. Thus, the boundaries between response mode regions in our model correspond to evolutionary tipping points, where even minor changes in environmental parameters can have dramatic and disproportionate consequences on population viability. Finally, we discuss how different life histories and genetic architectures may influence the location of tipping points in parameter space and the likelihood of extinction during such transitions. These insights can help identify and address some of the cryptic threats to natural populations that are likely to result from any natural or human-induced change in environmental conditions. They also demonstrate the potential value of evolutionary thinking in the study of global climate change.},

abstract = {Herbivory by megaherbivores on woody vegetation in general is well documented; however studies focusing on the individual browsing effects of both mega- and mesoherbivore species on recruitment are scarce. We determined these effects for elephant Loxodonta africana and nyala Tragelaphus angasii in the critically endangered Sand Forest, which is restricted to east southern Africa, and is conserved mainly in small reserves with high herbivore densities. Replicated experimental treatments (400 m2) in a single forest patch were used to exclude elephant, or both elephant and nyala. In each treatment, all woody individuals were identified to species and number of stems, diameter and height were recorded. Results of changes after two years are presented. Individual tree and stem densities had increased in absence of nyala and elephant. Seedling recruitment (based on height and diameter) was inhibited by nyala, and by elephant and nyala in combination, thereby preventing recruitment into the sapling stage. Neither nyala or elephant significantly reduced sapling densities. Excluding both elephant and nyala in combination enhanced recruitment of woody species, as seedling densities increased, indicating that forest regeneration is impacted by both mega- and mesoherbivores. The Sand Forest tree community approached an inverse J-shaped curve, with the highest abundance in the smaller size classes. However, the larger characteristic tree species in particular, such as Newtonia hildebrandtii, were missing cohorts in the middle size classes. When setting management goals to conserve habitats of key importance, conservation management plans need to consider the total herbivore assemblage present and the resulting browsing effects on vegetation. Especially in Africa, where the broadest suite of megaherbivores still persists, and which is currently dealing with the ‘elephant problem', the individual effects of different herbivore species on recruitment and dynamics of forests and woodlands are important issues which need conclusive answers.},

abstract = {Wildlife populations occur in increasingly fragmented landscapes, making corridor ecology important to conservation managers. Human disturbance has been identified as a proximate cause of limiting corridor use or increasing streaking behavior by wild elephants, but there are likely to be physiological triggers that directly initiate these risk averse behaviors. We simultaneously monitored elephant stress hormone concentrations and movement in two reserves to test whether elephants in an elevated physiological state restricted use of corridors, or, if they still used corridors, exhibited relatively rapid unidirectional movements indicative of streaking behavior. Contrary to predictions, the elephant population in an elevated physiological state did not reduce use of corridors between core areas. However, as predicted, when the population was in an elevated physiological state, elephant family groups exhibited less tortuosity, and moved 77{\%} faster when in corridors as opposed to core areas, compared to only a 20{\%} difference between corridor and core area speed when not in an elevated physiological state. Rapid movement along corridors by elephants in elevated physiological states is likely an adaptive behavioral response to avoid further exposure to stressors. Furthermore, because chronically stressed elephants can be more aggressive towards humans, understanding when and where elephants exhibit streaking behavior can guide human-elephant conflict mitigation. We demonstrate that corridor use can exist at relatively fine spatial scales within fenced reserves, and the persistent use of corridors regardless of physiological state suggests that they are likely an important, but neglected, component of animal spatial ecology within reserves. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Animals often exhibit changes in their behaviour during migration. Telemetry data provide a way to observe geographic position of animals over time, but not necessarily changes in the dynamics of the movement process. Continuous-time models allow for statistical predictions of the trajectory in the presence of measurement error and during periods when the telemetry device did not record the animal's position. However, continuous-time models capable of mimicking realistic trajectories with sufficient detail are computationally challenging to fit to large datasets. Furthermore, basic continuous-time model specifications (e.g. Brownian motion) lack realism in their ability to capture nonstationary dynamics. We present a unified class of animal movement models that are computationally efficient and provide a suite of approaches for accommodating nonstationarity in continuous trajectories due to migration and interactions among individuals. Our approach uses process convolutions to allow for flexibility in the movement process while facilitating implementation and incorporating location uncertainty. We show how to nest convolution models to incorporate interactions among migrating individuals to account for nonstationarity and provide inference about dynamic migratory networks. We demonstrate these approaches in two case studies involving migratory birds. Specifically, we used process convolution models with temporal deformation to account for heterogeneity in individual greater white-fronted goose migrations in Europe and Iceland, and we used nested process convolutions to model dynamic migratory networks in sandhill cranes in North America. The approach we present accounts for various forms of temporal heterogeneity in animal movement and is not limited to migratory applications. Furthermore, our models rely on well-established principles for modelling-dependent data and leverage modern approaches for modelling dynamic networks to help explain animal movement and social interaction.},

abstract = {Physical barriers, such as rivers and roads, constrain the movement of animals, usually by preventing access to adjacent habitats and impeding dispersal. Fences are artificial barriers that are commonly used as a conservation tool to intentionally restrict movements of animals to within protected reserves. However, the potential edge-effect of fences on the behaviour of animals within reserves is poorly understood. We examined the effect of fences on the movement patterns of African elephant (Loxodonta africana), an ecosystem modifier, in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. We used linear and non-linear models to determine the relationship between minimum distance from fence and seasonal daily net displacement of six GPS-collared female elephant. Elephant movement patterns were best explained by a piecewise regression that showed a strong negative relationship between minimum distance from fence and daily net displacement up to a " breakpoint" distance of 2551. m in the dry season and 3829. m in the wet season. The effect of the fence dissipated beyond this distance in both seasons. The increased tortuosity in movement patterns of elephant in the central area of the reserve suggested that they used this area more intensively for foraging compared to the peripheral area, as confirmed by differences in habitat selection. This occurs despite there being no difference in habitat composition between these areas. The decreased use of areas near the fence and more intensive foraging in the central areas constitute an important edge-effect of fences. Since elephant are ecosystem engineers, such edge-effects could potentially cascade throughout the reserve, adversely altering ecologically processes, particularly in reserves with a high edge-to-area ratio. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Opinions are divided as to whether human intervention to control elephant (Loxodonta africana) population growth is desirable, partly because of elephant welfare concerns. Female contraception through immunization with porcine zona pellucida (PZP) proteins is viable. The effects of sustained use and application of the PZP vaccine on elephant behavioral and spatial responses were examined by evaluating herd ranging, fission-fusion dynamics, association patterns, and reproductive and sexual behaviors. Minimal change was anticipated as a result of long calf dependence on and association with cows, a reduced but not indefinite 0{\%} growth rate and the known mechanism of action of PZP vaccines, and minimal expected change in resource requirements necessitating behavioral or spatial use adaptations. Although behavioral effects identified in previous hormonal contraceptive trials were evident, it was demonstrated that immunocontraception caused no prolonged behavioral, social, or spatial changes over the 11-yr study period. Individually identified elephants were monitored from 1999 to 2011. Minimal, short-term social disruption, with temporary changes to the herds' core ranges, was observed during the annual treatment events, particularly in the first three treatment years, when vaccinations were conducted exclusively from the ground. Thereafter, when vaccinations were conducted aerially, minor disruptions were confined to the morning of administration only. Despite sustained treatments resulting in demographic changes of fewer calves being born, treatments did not alter spatial range use, and no adverse interherd-intraherd relations were observed. Similarly, resource requirements did not change as calving still occurred, although in fewer numbers. It was concluded that PZP immunocontraception has no detectable behavioral or social consequences in elephants over the course of 11 yr, providing a convincing argument for the use of sustained immunocontraception in the medium to long term as an important tool for elephant management. Behavioral consequences of alternative management approaches should all receive similar scrutiny to enable managers to make informed decisions when weighing management interventions.},

abstract = {Panting is a controlled increase in respiratory frequency accompanied by a decrease in tidal volume, the purpose of which is to increase ventilation of the upper respiratory tract, preserve alveolar ventilation, and thereby elevate evaporative heat loss. The increased energy cost of panting is offset by reducing the metabolism of nonrespiratory muscles. The panting mechanism tends to be important in smaller mammalian species and in larger species is supplemented by sweating. At elevated respiratory frequencies and body temperatures alveolar hyperventilation begins to develop but is accompanied by a decline in the control of carbon dioxide partial pressure in arterial blood, probably through central chemoreceptors. Most heat exchange takes place at the nasal epithelial lining, and venous drainage can be directed to a special network of arteries at the base of the brain whereby countercurrent heat transfer can occur, which results in selective brain cooling. Such a phenomenon has also been suggested in nonpanting species, including humans, and although originally thought to be a mechanism for protecting the thermally vulnerable brain is now considered to be one of the thermoregulatory reflexes whereby respiratory evaporation can be closely controlled in the interests of thermal homeostasis.},

abstract = {Animals frequently exhibit consistent among-individual differences in behavioural and physiological traits that are inherently flexible. Why should individuals differ consistently in their expression of labile traits? Recently, positive feedbacks between state and behaviour have been proposed as a possible explanation for the maintenance of consistent among-individual differences in both state and behaviour. If state affects behaviour, and behaviour reciprocally affects state, then differences in either state or behaviour that arise among individuals even by chance could be maintained over extended periods of time. We tested for positive feedbacks experimentally using wild-caught red knots (Calidris canutus islandica). In the wild, knots exhibit consistent among-individual differences in digestive physiology (the mass of the muscular part of the stomach, the gizzard) and foraging behaviour (diet), two inherently labile traits. Experimentally manipulated diet quality had a large effect on gizzard mass. Experimentally manipulated gizzard mass reciprocally influenced total food eaten during ad libitum trials. The effect of gizzard mass on diet choice, though in the predicted direction, was not statistically significant. Individuals exhibited consistent differences in foraging behaviour of unknown origin independent of current gizzard mass, as well as large residual unexplained variance in foraging behaviour. These two sources of variation in foraging behaviour overruled the gizzard mass-dependent foraging behaviour and hence eroded the treatment-related differences in gizzard mass. We conclude that positive feedbacks between diet choice and gizzard mass play at best a limited role in maintaining among-individual variation in gizzard mass in red knots. Furthermore, we suggest that many models of state–behaviour feedbacks likely overestimate their potential importance in maintaining long-term among-individual variation in labile traits because most models of state–behaviour feedbacks fail to account for the effects of additional factors that may act to disrupt the feedback loops. The among-individual differences in diet choice observed during solitary foraging trials eroded the consistent among-individual differences in gizzard mass observed following periods of staple diet treatments in which knots foraged in social groups. Social foraging interactions may play an important role determining the expression of foraging behaviours such as intake rate that in turn influence gizzard mass. Further studies are needed to experimentally test the role of social interactions as a mechanism generating consistent among-individual differences in foraging behaviours and gizzard mass. A lay summary is available for this article.},

abstract = {Measurement of the time allocation of penguins at sea has been a major goal of researchers in recent years. Until now, however, no equipment has been available that would allow measurement of the aquatic and terrestrial behaviour of an Antarctic penguin while it is commuting between the colony and the foraging grounds. A new motion detector, based on the measurement of acceleration, has been used here in addition to current methods of inferring behaviour using data loggers that monitor depth and speed. We present data on the time allocation of Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) according to the different types of behaviours they display during their foraging trips: walking, tobogganing, standing on land, lying on land, resting at the water surface, porpoising and diving. To illustrate the potential of this new technique, we compared the behaviour of Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins during the chick-rearing period in a fast sea-ice region and an ice-free region. The proportion of time spent standing, lying on land and walking during foraging trips was greater for penguins in the sea-ice region (37.6+/-13.3{\%} standing, 21.6+/-15.6{\%} lying and 5.9+/-6.3{\%} walking) than for those in the ice-free region (12.0+/-15.8 {\%} standing, 0.38+/-0.60{\%} lying and 0 {\%} walking), whereas the proportion of time spent resting at the water surface and porpoising was greater for birds in the ice-free region (38.1+/-6.4{\%} resting and 1.1+/-1.1{\%} porpoising) than for those in the sea-ice region (3.0+/-2.3{\%} resting and 0{\%} porpoising; means +/- s.d., N=7 for the sea-ice region, N=4 for the ice-free region). Using this new approach, further studies combining the monitoring of marine resources in different Antarctic sites and the measurement of the energy expenditure of foraging penguins, e.g. using heart rates, will constitute a powerful tool for investigating the effects of environmental conditions on their foraging strategy. This technique will expand our ability to monitor many animals in the field.},

In both cases the cats{\&}{\#}039; hunting strategies are well matched to produce a balance between the energy they spend on the hunt and the energy they acquire from their prey, despite their very different strategies and levels of competition.Science, this issue p. 81, p. 79; see also p. 33 Pumas (Puma concolor) live in diverse, often rugged, complex habitats. The energy they expend for hunting must account for this complexity but is difficult to measure for this and other large, cryptic carnivores. We developed and deployed a physiological SMART (species movement, acceleration, and radio tracking) collar that used accelerometry to continuously monitor energetics, movements, and behavior of free-ranging pumas. This felid species displayed marked individuality in predatory activities, ranging from low-cost sit-and-wait behaviors to constant movements with energetic costs averaging 2.3 times those predicted for running mammals. Pumas reduce these costs by remaining cryptic and precisely matching maximum pouncing force (overall dynamic body acceleration = 5.3 to 16.1g) to prey size. Such instantaneous energetics help to explain why most felids stalk and pounce, and their analysis represents a powerful approach for accurately forecasting resource demands required for survival by large, mobile predators.},

abstract = {Aim Elevation and climate ranges across latitude experienced by 21 wide-ranging mammal species in western North America were summarized to examine two questions: (1) do populations in the northern and southern portions of a species' range experience different climates or are environments selected to remain similar to climates at the core of ranges; and (2) how do species' elevational ranges, experienced temperature seasonality and temperature ranges change across latitude? Given the larger effects of climate oscillations in the north vs. the south, a predicted outcome is for species to conserve climate niches across latitude and to show reduced climate and elevation ranges in the north. An alternative outcome is latitudinal niche diversification and increased climate variation in the north. Location Western North America. Methods The questions above were examined using a combination of species occurrence data bases, climate data bases, simple summaries of means and standard deviations and by testing summaries against random distributions across latitude for 21 mammal species from a variety of orders. Results The results showed that: (i) most species conserve their niche strongly or weakly given overall temperature gradients from north to south; (ii) seasonality experienced by species is relatively static until the highest latitudes despite directional trends across the region; and (iii) the elevation range and temperature variation that species experience decreases from south to north. Main conclusions Populations at range edges appear to partition environments to remain closer to temperature values similar to those at the core of the range. In addition, seasonality is not a likely explanatory factor of genetic diversity in latitudinal gradients. The data are instead more consistent with predictions that a combination of higher gene-flow, increasing environmental instability and decreasing elevation gradients in the north compared to the south may lead to negative correlations between latitude and species' climate variation. The results corroborate risks faced by northern mammal populations to global climate changes.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in using dynamic social networks in the study of animal sociality and its consequences. However, there is a general lack of guidance on the when and how such an approach will be valuable. The aim of this paper is to provide a guide on when to choose dynamic vs. static social network analysis, and how to choose the appropriate temporal scale for the dynamic network. I first discuss the motivations for using dynamic animal social networks. I then provide guidance on how to choose between dynamic networks and the “standard” approach of using static networks. I discuss this in the context of the temporal scale of changes observed, of their predictability and of the data availability. Dynamic networks are important in a number of scenarios. First, if the network data are being compared to independent processes, such as the spread of information or disease or environmental changes, then dynamic networks will provide more accurate estimates of spreading rates. Second, if the network has predictable patterns of change, for example diel cycles or seasonal changes, then dynamic networks should be used to capture the impact of these changes. Third, dynamic networks are important for studies of spread through networks when the relationship between edge weight and transmission probability is nonlinear. Finally, dynamic social networks are also useful in situations where interactions among individuals are dense, such as in studies of captive groups. The use of static vs. dynamic network requires careful consideration, both from a research question perspective and from a data perspective, and this paper provides a guide on how to evaluate the relative importance of these.},

abstract = {Small rodents with multi-annual population cycles strongly influence the dynamics of food webs, and in particular predator-prey interactions, across most of the tundra biome. Rodents are however absent from some arctic islands, and studies on performance of arctic predators under such circumstances may be very instructive since rodent cycles have been predicted to collapse in a warming Arctic. Here we document for the first time how three normally rodent-dependent predator species—rough-legged buzzard, arctic fox and red fox – perform in a low-arctic ecosystem with no rodents. During six years (in 2006-2008 and 2011-2013) we studied diet and breeding performance of these predators in the rodent-free Kolguev Island in Arctic Russia. The rough-legged buzzards, previously known to be a small rodent specialist, have only during the last two decades become established on Kolguev Island. The buzzards successfully breed on the island at stable low density, but with high productivity based on goslings and willow ptarmigan as their main prey – altogether representing a novel ecological situation for this species. Breeding density of arctic fox varied from year to year, but with stable productivity based on mainly geese as prey. The density dynamic of the arctic fox appeared to be correlated with the date of spring arrival of the geese. Red foxes breed regularly on the island but in very low numbers that appear to have been unchanged over a long period – a situation that resemble what has been recently documented from Arctic America. Our study suggests that the three predators found breeding on Kolguev Island possess capacities for shifting to changing circumstances in low-arctic ecosystem as long as other small - medium sized terrestrial herbivores are present in good numbers.},

abstract = {Fragmentation-the process by which habitats are transformed into smaller patches isolated from each other-has been identified as a major threat for biodiversity. Fragmentation has well-established demographic and population genetic consequences, eroding genetic diversity and hindering gene flow among patches. However, fragmentation should also select on life history, both predictably through increased isolation, demographic stochasticity and edge effects, and more idiosyncratically via altered biotic interactions. While species have adapted to natural fragmentation, adaptation to anthropogenic fragmentation has received little attention. In this review, we address how and whether organisms might adapt to anthropogenic fragmentation. Drawing on selected case studies and evolutionary ecology models, we show that anthropogenic fragmentation can generate selection on traits at both the patch and landscape scale, and affect the adaptive potential of populations. We suggest that dispersal traits are likely to experience especially strong selection, as dispersal both enables migration among patches and increases the risk of landing in the inhospitable matrix surrounding them. We highlight that suites of associated traits are likely to evolve together. Importantly, we show that adaptation will not necessarily rescue populations from the negative effects of fragmentation, and may even exacerbate them, endangering the entire metapopulation.This article is part of the themed issue 'Human influences on evolution, and the ecological and societal consequences'.},

We evaluated the relationships between apparent thermoregulatory behaviour and environmental, skin and core temperatures for tame savanna elephants (Loxodonta afri-cana) that were free-ranging in the hot parts of the day, in their natural environment. Environmental temperature dictated elephant behaviour within a day, with potential consequences for fine-scale habitat selection, space use and foraging. At black globe temperatures of ∼30°C, elephants adjusted their behaviour to reduce environmental heat load and increase heat dissipation (e.g. shade use, wetting behaviour). Resting, walking and feeding were also influenced by environmental temperature. By relying on behavioural and autonomic adjustments, the elephants maintained homeothermy, even at environmental temperatures exceeding 40°C. Elephants clearly have the capacity to deal with extreme heat, at least in environments with adequate resources of forage, water and shade. Future conservation actions should provide for the thermoregulatory, resource and spatial needs of elephants.},

abstract = {Opinions are divided as to whether human intervention to control elephant (Loxodonta africana) population growth is desirable, partly because of elephant welfare concerns. Female contraception through immunization with porcine zona pellucida (PZP) proteins is viable. The effects of sustained use and application of the PZP vaccine on elephant behavioral and spatial responses were examined by evaluating herd ranging, fission-fusion dynamics, association patterns, and reproductive and sexual behaviors. Minimal change was anticipated as a result of long calf dependence on and association with cows, a reduced but not indefinite 0{\%} growth rate and the known mechanism of action of PZP vaccines, and minimal expected change in resource requirements necessitating behavioral or spatial use adaptations. Although behavioral effects identified in previous hormonal contraceptive trials were evident, it was demonstrated that immunocontraception caused no prolonged behavioral, social, or spatial changes over the 11-yr study period. Individually identified elephants were monitored from 1999 to 2011. Minimal, short-term social disruption, with temporary changes to the herds' core ranges, was observed during the annual treatment events, particularly in the first three treatment years, when vaccinations were conducted exclusively from the ground. Thereafter, when vaccinations were conducted aerially, minor disruptions were confined to the morning of administration only. Despite sustained treatments resulting in demographic changes of fewer calves being born, treatments did not alter spatial range use, and no adverse interherd-intraherd relations were observed. Similarly, resource requirements did not change as calving still occurred, although in fewer numbers. It was concluded that PZP immunocontraception has no detectable behavioral or social consequences in elephants over the course of 11 yr, providing a convincing argument for the use of sustained immunocontraception in the medium to long term as an important tool for elephant management. Behavioral consequences of alternative management approaches should all receive similar scrutiny to enable managers to make informed decisions when weighing management interventions.},

abstract = {A central question in the study of predator-prey relationships is to what extent prey behaviour is determined by avoidance of predators. Here, we test whether the long-term risk of encountering lions and the presence of lions in the vicinity influence the behaviour of large African herbivores at waterholes through avoidance of high-risk areas, increases in group size, changes in temporal niche or changes in the time spent in waterhole areas. In Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we monitored waterholes to study the behaviour of nine herbivore species under different risks of encountering lions. We radio-collared 26 lions in the study area which provided the opportunity to monitor whether lions were present during observation sessions and to map longer-term seasonal landscapes of risk of encountering lions. Our results show that the preferred prey species for lions (buffalo, kudu and giraffe) avoided risky waterholes. Group size increased as encounter risk increased for only two species (wildebeest and zebra), but this effect was not strong. Interestingly, buffalo avoided the hours of the day which are dangerous when the long-term and short-term risks of encountering lions were high, and all species showed avoidance of waterhole use at night times when lions were in the vicinity. This illustrates well how prey can make temporal adjustments to avoid dangerous periods coinciding with predator hunting. Additionally, many herbivores spent more time accessing water to drink when the long- and short-term risks of encountering lions were high, and they showed longer potential drinking time when the long-term risk of encountering lions was high, suggesting higher levels of vigilance. This study illustrates the diversity of behavioural adjustments to the risk of encountering a predator and how prey respond differently to temporal variations in this risk. ¬{\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2009.},

Shrub density increased with distance from the watering point, with the impact of large herbivores on shrub density extending up to 2.8km. The practice of providing artificial water in troughs at windmills in the Kruger National Park causes the formation of a multiple piosphere effect, with the existence of a zone of high utilization in woody vegetation extending far beyond the sacrifice area.},

abstract = {▪ Abstract The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms.

abstract = {Predictions of animal distribution and resource use require multi-scale consideration because animals can use different sets of selection criteria at different scales. We investigated whether patterns of distribution and resource use by free-ranging bison (Bison bison) in Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan, follow rules of energy maximization that hold across multiple scales. Optimality theory predicts specialization on Carex atherodes and frequency-independent selection among plant species; that is, local variation in C. atherodes biomass should not influence diet choice but only the time spent in individual patches. The summer use of resources within meadows was closely related to energy maximization principles. C. atherodes dominated the diet of bison, was selected in all meadows, and diet choice was frequency-independent among meadows in the bison range. In winter, diet was still dominated by C. atherodes, but frequency-dependent selection of Scolochloa festucacea and the relative use of Cirsium arvense were inconsistent with theoretical predictions. At a larger spatial scale, however, the probability of meadow use was not positively related to the abundance of Carex atherodes. During summer and winter, general landscape features within the daily radius of bison (2 km in summer and 1.3 km in winter), together with abiotic characteristics of meadows, had the major influence on the probability of meadow utilization. Our study suggests that bison distribution and resource use are influenced by abiotic and biotic factors which vary in importance at different spatio-temporal scales.},

abstract = {Managers of reintroduced wildlife commonly encounter behavioral problems post-release that have been linked to physiological condition and elevated stress hormone concentrations. However, there is uncertainty about the generality of a stress response among populations, factors influencing the intensity of the response and the amount of time needed to physiologically acclimatize. We evalu- ated the relationship of temporal, climatic and social factors to stress hormone concentrations in five African elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations follow- ing reintroduction. We determined fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations (FGMs) in 1567 fecal samples collected from elephants reintroduced to five fenced reserves with differing reintroduction histories in South Africa during 2000–2006. Variation in FGMs across the five reserves was best explained by the number of years that elapsed since initial release. Compared with FGMs 1 year after release, FGMs were 10{\%} lower 10 years after release and 40{\%} lower 24 years after release. Across all reserves, FGMs were consistently highest in the dry season, although daily and monthly temperature and rainfall were not as important as other factors. FGMs did not vary solely in relationship to reserve size or elephant density. Our findings suggest that regardless of reintroduction site conditions, elephants and likely other species subject to reintroduction require an extended period of time to physiologically acclimatize to their new surroundings. Managers should prepare for prolonged behavioral and physiological consequences of long-term elevated stress responses following reintroduction, such as restricted space use and aggres- sive behavior.},

abstract = {Water and forage are key non-substitutable resources for herbivores in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. The distribution of surface water determines the distribution and abundance of water dependent animal species: yet little is known about the processes involved at the individual level. Thirteen African savanna elephant family groups and ten bulls (Loxodonta Africana) were tracked with GPS collars within and on the outskirts of Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Elephants behave as multiple central place foragers: They visit waterholes periodically every 5h, 24h, 48h or 72h and travel further from water during longer trips. During the dry season, temperatures increase and forage becomes depleted closer to water. Elephant family groups visit waterholes more often by increasing the proportion of briefer trips and abandoning 72h trips. However, they forage further during 24h trips by increasing travelling speed. Elephant movement patterns reveal that locomotional and navigational abilities are at the core of their coping strategies although these abilities are seldom allowed to vary in most foraging models of animal's use of heterogeneously distributed resources. During these foraging trips, family herds select areas with low waterhole density at multiple scales. Selection strength for low density areas increases with both distance to water and the advancement of the dry season. While scaling effects are widely recognized, the effects of the spatial distribution of multiple central places constraining foraging have been ignored although they determine depletion effects and their feedbacks on habitat selection. I also showed that elephant and buffalo strongly avoid livestock and people that herd them at the boundary of a protected area during the rainy season. Nevertheless, avoidance decreases during the dry season when foraging and drinking resources become scarce. Elephants are increasingly constrained by surface water availability during the dry season as their drinking requirements increase while they strive to maintain their forage intake. This study provides quantitative assessment of individual water dependence and of landscape effects of surface water distribution on a large herbivore. These findings can inform surface water management in contexts of aridification resulting from climate change.},

abstract = {Information on age- and tactic-related paternity success is essential for understanding the lifetime reproductive strategy of males and constitutes an important component of the fitness trade-offs that shape the life-history traits of a species. The degree of reproductive skew impacts the genetic structure of a population and should be considered when developing conservation strategies for threatened species. The behavior and genetic structure of species with large reproductive skew may be disproportionately impacted by anthropogenic actions affecting reproductively dominant individuals. Our results on age- and tactic-specific paternity success in male African elephants are the first from a free-ranging population and demonstrate that paternity success increases dramatically with age, with the small number of older bulls in the competitive state of musth being the most successful sires. However, nonmusth males sired 20{\%} of genotyped calves, and 60{\%} of mature bulls (.20 years old) were estimated to have sired offspring during the 5-year study period. The 3 most successful males sired less than 20{\%} of the genotyped offspring. Hence, contrary to prediction from behavior and life-history traits, reproduction was not heavily skewed compared with many other mammalian systems with a similar breeding system. Nevertheless, these results indicate that trophy hunting and ivory poaching, both of which target older bulls, may have substantial behavioral and genetic effects on elephant populations. In addition, these results are critical to the current debate on methods for managing and controlling increasing populations of this species.

abstract = {Elephant inhabiting arid and semi-arid savannas often experience periods of drought, which, if prolonged, may cause mortality. During dry periods, elephant aggregate around water sources and deplete local forage availability. However, the relationships between adult elephant mortality and both high local elephant density and forage availability close to water during dry periods remain unexplored. We hypothesized that elephant mortality is higher: a) when dry periods are longer, b) closer to water points, and c) in areas with higher local elephant density. Using nine years of elephant carcass data from Tsavo Conservation Area in Kenya, we analysed the probability of adult elephant mortality using maximum entropy modelling (MaxEnt). We found that elephant carcasses were aggregated and elephant mortality was negatively correlated with four months cumulative precipitation prior to death (which contributed 41{\%} to the model), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (19{\%}) and distance to water (6{\%}), while local elephant density (19{\%}) showed a positive correlation. Three seasons (long dry, short dry and short wet seasons) showed high probability of elephant mortality, whereas low probability was found during long wet seasons. Our results strongly suggest that elephants starve to death in prolonged drought. Artificial water holes may lead to lower mortality, but also to larger populations with subsequent high browsing pressure on the vegetation. Our results suggest that elephant populations in arid and semi-arid savannas appear to be regulated by drought-induced mortalities, which may be the best way of controlling elephant numbers without having to cull.},

abstract = {Body mass is the primary determinant of an animal's energy requirements. At their optimum walking speed, large animals have lower mass-specific energy requirements for locomotion than small ones. In animals ranging in size from 0.8 g (roach) to 260 kg (zebu steer), the minimum cost of transport (COT(min)) decreases with increasing body size roughly as COT(min)∝body mass (M(b))(-0.316±0.023) (95{\%} CI). Typically, the variation of COT(min) with body mass is weaker at the intraspecific level as a result of physiological and geometric similarity within closely related species. The interspecific relationship estimates that an adult elephant, with twice the body mass of a mid-sized elephant, should be able to move its body approximately 23{\%} cheaper than the smaller elephant. We sought to determine whether adult Asian and sub-adult African elephants follow a single quasi-intraspecific relationship, and extend the interspecific relationship between COT(min) and body mass to 12-fold larger animals. Physiological and possibly geometric similarity between adult Asian elephants and sub-adult African elephants caused body mass to have a no effect on COT(min) (COT(min)∝M(b)(0.007±0.455)). The COT(min) in elephants occurred at walking speeds between 1.3 and ∼1.5 m s(-1), and at Froude numbers between 0.10 and 0.24. The addition of adult Asian elephants to the interspecific relationship resulted in COT(min)∝M (-0.277±0.046)(b). The quasi-intraspecific relationship between body mass and COT(min) among elephants caused the interspecific relationship to underestimate COT(min) in larger elephants.},

abstract = {The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis specifies that closely related species or populations experiencing different ecological conditions should differ in a suite of metabolic, hormonal and immunity traits that have coevolved with the life-history particularities related to these conditions. Surprisingly, two important dimensions of the POLS concept have been neglected: (i) despite increasing evidence for numerous connections between behavioural, physiological and life-history traits, behaviours have rarely been considered in the POLS yet; (ii) the POLS could easily be applied to the study of covariation among traits between individuals within a population. In this paper, we propose that consistent behavioural differences among individuals, or personality, covary with life history and physiological differences at the within-population, interpopulation and interspecific levels. We discuss how the POLS provides a heuristic framework in which personality studies can be integrated to address how variation in personality traits is maintained within populations.},

abstract = {Information on age- and tactic-related paternity success is essential for understanding the lifetime reproductive strategy of males and constitutes an important component of the fitness trade-offs that shape the life-history traits of a species. The degree of reproductive skew impacts the genetic structure of a population and should be considered when developing conservation strategies for threatened species. The behavior and genetic structure of species with large reproductive skew may be disproportionately impacted by anthropogenic actions affecting reproductively dominant individuals. Our results on age- and tactic-specific paternity success in male African elephants are the first from a free-ranging population and demonstrate that paternity success increases dramatically with age, with the small number of older bulls in the competitive state of musth being the most successful sires. However, nonmusth males sired 20{\%} of genotyped calves, and 60{\%} of mature bulls (.20 years old) were estimated to have sired offspring during the 5-year study period. The 3 most successful males sired less than 20{\%} of the genotyped offspring. Hence, contrary to prediction from behavior and life-history traits, reproduction was not heavily skewed compared with many other mammalian systems with a similar breeding system. Nevertheless, these results indicate that trophy hunting and ivory poaching, both of which target older bulls, may have substantial behavioral and genetic effects on elephant populations. In addition, these results are critical to the current debate on methods for managing and controlling increasing populations of this species. Key words: Eelephants, musth, paternity, reproductive strategy, skew, tactic.},

Due to their large size, it might be expected that elephants have particular physiological adaptations, such as adjustments to the rhythms of their core body temperature (Tb) to deal with environmental challenges. This study describes for the first time the Tbdaily rhythms in savanna elephants. Our results showed that elephants had lower mean Tbvalues (36.2 ± 0.49 °C) than smaller ungulates inhabiting similar environments but did not have larger or smaller amplitudes of Tbvariation (0.40 ± 0.12 °C), as would be predicted by their exposure to large fluctuations in ambient temperature or their large size. No difference was found between the daily Tbrhythms measured under different conditions of water stress. Peak Tb's occurred late in the evening (22:10) which is generally later than in other large mammals ranging in similar environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In a flock of tame, free-flying bar-headed geese {\textless}i{\textgreater}(Anser indicus){\textless}/i{\textgreater} the structure, stability and causes of the dominance hierarchy among different types of social units were studied. 1. In accordance with field results of other authors, families proved dominant over pairs, pairs over unpaired birds, and single males dominated single females. Single females with young ranked between families and pairs in this study, and lone breeding males whose females were incubating ranked between pairs and unpaired individuals. Contrary to some field studies, no rank differences were found between different-sized families. 2. The dominance value of pairs in winter correlated with subsequent fledging success, and there was some casual evidence that high-ranking males are more likely to obtain a mate. This would result in relating high rank to families, medium rank to pairs and low rank to unpaired birds. Yet as temporarily leaving the mate was promptly followed by a drop in rank and successful breeding by a rise in rank, the social context seems a major cause, and only to a minor extent a consequence of dominance rank. 3. Age correlated more strongly with a pair{\&}apos;s rank in winter than weight, tarsus length and upper beak length. Rank in summer correlated highly with rank in the following winter. A positive feedback system age - dominance - fledging success-higher dominance-fledging success{\&}apos; is suggested which could account for the {\&}apos;delayed breeding{\&}apos; common in geese and swans. 4. In pairs or families male age correlated more strongly than female age with winter dominance. Most opponents were displayed by the male alone, and only the male of a pair got involved in highest intensity aggression (wing-beat fighting). The widowed female of one high-ranking pair was low-ranking in subsequent years when paired with a young low-ranking male. The evidence suggests that the gander alone determines a family{\&}apos;s or pair{\&}apos;s rank. 5. There was no indication of a positive co-operative effect achieved by joint aggression. Comparison of frequencies of aggressive acts and postures between birds in different social contexts suggested that the presence of the mate and/or offspring increases fighting motivation, thus explaining the dependence of rank on the social context. 6. The stability of dyadic dominance relationships between social units was greater between than within social classes. The hierarchy of social classes can be explained by geese signalling their degree of fighting motivation to each other. Individual recognition of members of other social units seems of minor importance for the hierarchy even in this stable flock.},

We propose a new model for this segmentation/clustering problem, combining a segmentation model with a mixture model. We present a new hybrid algorithm called dynamic programming–expectation maximization (DP–EM) to estimate the parameters of the model by maximum likelihood. This algorithm combines DP and the EM algorithm. We also propose a model selection heuristic to select the number of clusters and the number of segments. An example of our procedure is presented, based on publicly available data sets. We compare our method to segmentation methods and to hidden Markov models, and we show that the new segmentation/clustering model is a promising alternative that can be applied in the more general context of signal processing.},

abstract = {Behaviors can facilitate colonization of a novel environment, but the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. On one hand, behavioral flexibility allows for an immediate response of colonizers to novel environments, which is critical to population establishment and persistence. On the other hand, integrated sets of behaviors that display limited flexibility can enhance invasion success by coupling behaviors with dispersal strategies that are especially important during natural range expansions. Direct observations of colonization events are required to determine the mechanisms underlying changes in behavior associated with colonization, but such observations are rare. Here, we studied changes in aggression on a large temporal and spatial scale across populations of two sister taxa of bluebirds (Sialia) to show that coupling of aggression and dispersal strongly facilitated the range expansion of western bluebirds across the northwestern United States over the last 30 years. We show that biased dispersal of highly aggressive males to the invasion front allowed western bluebirds to displace less aggressive mountain bluebirds. However, once mountain bluebirds were excluded, aggression of western bluebirds decreased rapidly across consecutive generations in concordance with local selection on highly heritable aggressive behavior. Further, the observed adaptive microevolution of aggression was accelerated by the link between dispersal propensity and aggression. Importantly, our results show that behavioral changes among populations were not caused by behavioral flexibility and instead strongly implicate adaptive integration of dispersal and aggression in facilitating the ongoing and rapid reciprocal range change of these species in North America.},

abstract = {Behavioral and physiological adaptations are common and successful strategies used by small endothermic species to adjust to unfavorable seasons. Physiological adaptations, such as heterothermy, e.g., torpor, are usually thought to be more effective energy-saving strategies than behavioral adjustments. The African lesser bushbaby, Galago moholi, is physiologically capable of torpor but expresses heterothermy only under conditions of extreme energy limitation, suggesting that it has evolved alternative strategies to compensate energetic bottlenecks. We hypothesized that Galago moholi survives the unfavorable winter period, without -or only rarely- employing torpid phases to save energy, by using behavioral thermoregulation. We compared the ecology and behavior of Galago moholi in summer and winter by telemetric tracking and examined food availability by determination of arthropod and gum availability. We found a significant increase in huddling behavior and a significant increase in the use of enclosed and insulated sleeping sites during winter, as well as a reduction in nightly activity. Galago moholi hunted for insects significantly less in winter than in summer, and increased gum intake in winter, when gum showed an increase in energy content. The availability of high-quality food, albeit in low quantities, presumably enables Galago moholi to stay normothermic throughout the cold, dry period and to focus on reproduction activities. We propose that Galago moholi favors ecological and behavioral adjustments over torpor because these are sufficient to meet energy requirements of this species, and their advantages (flexibility, unrestricted activity, and reproduction) outweigh the energetic benefits of heterothermy.},

This paper reports on trends found at two artificial watering points on the basaltic soils in the Satara Land System. As a result of the almost complete lack of woody individuals in the immediate vicinity of the watering points, this area could be described as a sacrifice area. Shrub density increased with distance from the watering point, with the impact of large herbivores on shrub density extending up to 2.8km. The practice of providing artificial water in troughs at windmills in the Kruger National Park causes the formation of a multiple piosphere effect, with the existence of a zone of high utilization in woody vegetation extending far beyond the sacrifice area.},

abstract = {Using implanted temperature loggers, we measured core body temperature in nine western grey kangaroos every 5 min for 24 to 98 days in spring and summer. Body temperature was highest at night and decreased rapidly early in the morning, reaching a nadir at 10:00 h, after ambient temperature and solar radiation had begun to increase. On hotter days, the minimum morning body temperature was lower than on cooler days, decreasing from a mean of 36.2°C in the spring to 34.0°C in the summer. This effect correlated better with the time of the year than with proximate thermal stressors, suggesting that either season itself or some factor correlated with season, such as food availability, caused the change. Water saving has been proposed as a selective advantage of heterothermy in other large mammals, but in kangaroos the water savings would have been small and not required in a reserve with permanent standing water. We calculate that the lower core temperature could provide energy savings of nearly 7{\%}. It is likely that the heterothermy that we observed on hot days results either from decreased energy intake during the dry season or from a seasonal pattern entrained in the kangaroos that presumably has been selected for because of decreased energy availability during the dry season.},

abstract = {Predicting whether behaviour could buffer the effects of climate change on long-lived mammals requires a better understanding of the long-term behavioural responses of mammals to environmental stress. Using biologging, we measured locomotor activity and microclimate selection, over eight months, in five Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) living free in a Saudi Arabian desert. The oryx displayed seasonal flexibility in activity patterns, shifting from a continuous 24-h activity pattern with crepuscular peaks in cooler months to a predominantly nocturnal activity pattern during the hottest months, without reducing the total 24-h activity level. The proportion of total 24-h activity that occurred during daylight hours was just 29 ± 8{\%} during the hottest months, versus 53 ± 8{\%} (mean ± SD, n=5 oryx) in the other months. The attenuation in diurnal activity levels during the hot months was accompanied by the selection of cooler microclimates, presumably via shade seeking, during the heat of the day. Analysis of miniature black globe (miniglobe) temperature from a remote sensor on the collar of two female animals revealed that oryx selected microclimates cooler than the microclimates in direct sun at higher environmental heat loads across all periods, but with enhanced efficiency during the dry periods. We have quantified activity re-assignment and microclimate selection as responses to hot arid conditions in a free-living artiodactyl. Such flexible behavioural processes may act to buffer the adverse effects of the progressively hotter and drier conditions predicted to occur with climate change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {In a contemporary clinical laboratory it is very common to have to assess the agreement between two quantitative methods of measurement. The correct statistical approach to assess this degree of agreement is not obvious. Correlation and regression studies are frequently proposed. However, correlation studies the relationship between one variable and another, not the differences, and it is not recommended as a method for assessing the comparability between methods. In 1983 Altman and Bland (B{\&}A) proposed an alternative analysis, based on the quantification of the agreement between two quantitative measurements by studying the mean difference and constructing limits of agreement. The B{\&}A plot analysis is a simple way to evaluate a bias between the mean differences, and to estimate an agreement interval, within which 95{\%} of the differences of the second method, compared to the first one, fall. Data can be analyzed both as unit differences plot and as percentage differences plot. The B{\&}A plot method only defines the intervals of agreements, it does not say whether those limits are acceptable or not. Acceptable limits must be defined a priori, based on clinical necessity, biological considerations or other goals. The aim of this article is to provide guidance on the use and interpretation of Bland Altman analysis in method comparison studies.},

Reasons are advanced for believing that ear blood flow is controlled in the interests of thermoregulation.

abstract = {The influence of elephants on woody vegetation cover varies from place to place. In part this may be due to the way elephants utilize space across landscapes and within their home ranges in response to the availability and distribution of food. We used location data from 18 cows at six study sites across an east to west rainfall gradient in southern Africa to test whether wet- and dry-season home-range sizes, evenness of space use within seasonal home ranges and range overlap between seasons and between years, differed between wet and dry savannas. We then tested whether the quantity, distribution and seasonal stability in vegetation productivity, a coarse measure of food for elephants, explained differences. Elephants in wet savannas had smaller wet- and dry-season home ranges and also returned to a higher proportion of previously visited grid cells between seasons and between years than elephants living in dry savannas. Wet-season home-range sizes were explained by seasonal vegetation productivity while dry-season home-range sizes were explained by heterogeneity in the distribution of vegetation productivity. The influence of the latter on dry-season home ranges differed among structural vegetation classes. Range overlap between seasons and between years was related to inter-seasonal and inter-annual stability in vegetation productivity, respectively. Evenness of elephant spatial use within home ranges did not differ between savanna types, but it was explained by seasonal vegetation productivity and heterogeneity in the distribution of vegetation productivity during the wet season. Differences in elephant spatial use patterns between wet and dry savannas according to vegetation structure and season may need to be included in the development of site-specific objectives and management approaches for African elephants.},

abstract = {Within a landscape where prey has an aggregated distribution, predators can take advantage of the spatial autocorrelation of prey density and intensify their search effort in areas of high prey density by using area-restricted search behaviour. In African arid and semi-arid savannas, large herbivores tend to aggregate around scarce water sources. We tested the hypothesis that water sources are a key determinant of habitat selection and movement patterns of large free-ranging predators in such savannas, using the example of the African lion. We used data from 19 GPS radio-collared lions in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Maps of lions' trajectories showed that waterholes are key loci on the lions' route-maps. Compositional analyses revealed that lions significantly selected for areas located within 2 km of a waterhole. In addition, analysis of lions' night paths showed that when lions are close to a waterhole ($\backslash$textless 2 km), they move at lower speed, cover shorter distances per night (both path length and net displacement) and follow a more tortuous path (higher turning angle, lower straightness index and higher fractal dimension) than when they are further from a waterhole. Hence, our results strongly suggest that lions adopt area-restricted searching in the vicinity of waterholes, and reduce their search effort to minimize the time spent far from a waterhole. They provide an illustration of how key habitat features that determine the dispersion of prey (e.g. waterholes in this study) have an influence on the spatial ecology and movement patterns of terrestrial predators.},

A similar difference was also observed for the movement rates, with the highest average rate of hourly movement recorded during the wet season.

The elephant were trained to carry people were engaged in short term daily programmes for tourist or public education groups and normally spend the remainder of the daytime moving freely through the 800 ha reserve. The internal body temperature was recorded by ingested data loggers (i-Button DS19221, Maxim Integrated Products, California, USA) 'set to record the temperature every five minute intervals to determine the 24 hour pattern of body temperature as well as the magnitude and frequency of short-term variation in body temperature'. The data loggers were given to the elephants by placing it by hand towards the back of the tongue and suppyling a constant stream of water from a hosepipe until th e data logger was swallowed. The data loggers were retrieved from the faeces. Mean body temperature over the July 2006-November 2007 study period was about 36.4 +/-0.03 degrees C and mean daily amplitude was about 1.2 +/- 0.04 degrees C. Body temperature appeared to be largely independent from the environmenal temperature which ranges form -1 to 52 degrees C. Large short term changes of $\backslash$textgreater0.3 degrees seemed to be associated with ingestion of water, but either swimming or spashing caused a drop in temperature on a consistent basis. It appeared the elephants engaged in these latter behaviours for thermal comfort or pleasure rather than lowering body temperature. Higher than average body temperature was not associted with higher that average ear flapping, but the rate flappng increased with the increase in enviromnental temperature. 'I conclude that despite their large size, African elephtants, with access to water, regulate their body temperture within narrow limits, with a 24 hour pattern similar to that seen in other medium- to large-sized mammals.},

abstract = {In an era of rapid climate change, there is a pressing need to understand how organisms will cope with faster and less predictable variation in environmental conditions. Here we develop a unifying model that predicts evolutionary responses to environmentally driven fluctuating selection and use this theoretical framework to explore the potential consequences of altered environmental cycles. We first show that the parameter space determined by different combinations of predictability and timescale of environmental variation is partitioned into distinct regions where a single mode of response (reversible phenotypic plasticity, irreversible phenotypic plasticity, bet-hedging, or adaptive tracking) has a clear selective advantage over all others. We then demonstrate that, although significant environmental changes within these regions can be accommodated by evolution, most changes that involve transitions between regions result in rapid population collapse and often extinction. Thus, the boundaries between response mode regions in our model correspond to evolutionary tipping points, where even minor changes in environmental parameters can have dramatic and disproportionate consequences on population viability. Finally, we discuss how different life histories and genetic architectures may influence the location of tipping points in parameter space and the likelihood of extinction during such transitions. These insights can help identify and address some of the cryptic threats to natural populations that are likely to result from any natural or human-induced change in environmental conditions. They also demonstrate the potential value of evolutionary thinking in the study of global climate change.},

abstract = {Wildlife management to reduce the impact of wildlife on their habitat can be done in several ways, among which removing animals (by either culling or translocation) is most often used. There are, however, alternative ways to control wildlife densities, such as opening or closing water points. The effects of these alternatives are poorly studied. In this paper, we focus on manipulating large herbivores through the closure of water points (WPs). Removal of artificial WPs has been suggested in order to change the distribution of African elephants, which occur in high densities in national parks in Southern Africa and are thought to have a destructive effect on the vegetation. Here, we modeled the long-term effects of different scenarios of WP closure on the spatial distribution of elephants, and consequential effects on the vegetation and other herbivores in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Using a dynamic ecosystem model, SAVANNA, scenarios were evaluated that varied in availability of artificial WPs; levels of natural water; and elephant densities. Our modeling results showed that elephants can indirectly negatively affect the distributions of meso-mixed feeders, meso-browsers, and some meso-grazers under wet conditions. The closure of artificial WPs hardly had any effect during these natural wet conditions. Under dry conditions, the spatial distribution of both elephant bulls and cows changed when the availability of artificial water was severely reduced in the model. These changes in spatial distribution triggered changes in the spatial availability of woody biomass over the simulation period of 80 years, and this led to changes in the rest of the herbivore community, resulting in increased densities of all herbivores, except for giraffe and steenbok, in areas close to rivers. The spatial distributions of elephant bulls and cows showed to be less affected by the closure of WPs than most of the other herbivore species. Our study contributes to ecologically informed decisions in wildlife management. The results from this modeling exercise imply that long-term effects of this intervention strategy should always be investigated at an ecosystem scale.},

abstract = {Predictions of animal distribution and resource use require multi-scale consideration because animals can use different sets of selection criteria at different scales. We investigated whether patterns of distribution and resource use by free-ranging bison (Bison bison) in Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan, follow rules of energy maximization that hold across multiple scales. Optimality theory predicts specialization on Carex atherodes and frequency-independent selection among plant species; that is, local variation in C. atherodes biomass should not influence diet choice but only the time spent in individual patches. The summer use of resources within meadows was closely related to energy maximization principles. C. atherodes dominated the diet of bison, was selected in all meadows, and diet choice was frequency-independent among meadows in the bison range. In winter, diet was still dominated by C. atherodes, but frequency-dependent selection of Scolochloa festucacea and the relative use of Cirsium arvense were inconsistent with theoretical predictions. At a larger spatial scale, however, the probability of meadow use was not positively related to the abundance of Carex atherodes. During summer and winter, general landscape features within the daily radius of bison (2 km in summer and 1.3 km in winter), together with abiotic characteristics of meadows, had the major influence on the probability of meadow utilization. Our study suggests that bison distribution and resource use are influenced by abiotic and biotic factors which vary in importance at different spatio-temporal scales.},

These collars supply sequential location records according to a pre-set schedule, without any interference by an observer with animal movements. We report findings from a preliminary analysis of data from collars placed on two adjoining herds of sable antelope (Hippotragus niger) in the central region of the Kruger National Park. These collars functioned for 11.5 months and 15 months, respectively, routinely supplying GPS positions of both herds at 12 h (or shorter) intervals. From these data we derived diel displacement distances between locations 24 h apart, as well as diurnal and nocturnal (12 h) displacements. Annual home ranges of these herds covered 118 km(2) and 65 km(2), respectively. Diel displacements did not show any consistent distinction between short movements within foraging areas and long movements between foraging areas. Diel displacements increased over the course of the dry season, largely as a result of journeys to water every 3-4 days. Animals moved relatively more nocturnally during the hot months of the dry season than at other times of the year. Longer movements suggested higher energy expenditures and greater risks of predation in the late dry season.},

abstract = {Herbivory by megaherbivores on woody vegetation in general is well documented; however studies focusing on the individual browsing effects of both mega- and mesoherbivore species on recruitment are scarce. We determined these effects for elephant Loxodonta africana and nyala Tragelaphus angasii in the critically endangered Sand Forest, which is restricted to east southern Africa, and is conserved mainly in small reserves with high herbivore densities. Replicated experimental treatments (400 m2) in a single forest patch were used to exclude elephant, or both elephant and nyala. In each treatment, all woody individuals were identified to species and number of stems, diameter and height were recorded. Results of changes after two years are presented. Individual tree and stem densities had increased in absence of nyala and elephant. Seedling recruitment (based on height and diameter) was inhibited by nyala, and by elephant and nyala in combination, thereby preventing recruitment into the sapling stage. Neither nyala or elephant significantly reduced sapling densities. Excluding both elephant and nyala in combination enhanced recruitment of woody species, as seedling densities increased, indicating that forest regeneration is impacted by both mega- and mesoherbivores. The Sand Forest tree community approached an inverse J-shaped curve, with the highest abundance in the smaller size classes. However, the larger characteristic tree species in particular, such as Newtonia hildebrandtii, were missing cohorts in the middle size classes. When setting management goals to conserve habitats of key importance, conservation management plans need to consider the total herbivore assemblage present and the resulting browsing effects on vegetation. Especially in Africa, where the broadest suite of megaherbivores still persists, and which is currently dealing with the ‘elephant problem', the individual effects of different herbivore species on recruitment and dynamics of forests and woodlands are important issues which need conclusive answers.},

A random search is expected for an animal with no information on the location of the target resource, else, a direction-oriented walk is expected. We hypothesized that elephants movement patterns show a stronger directional orientation towards water sources in the dry season compared to the wet season. We investigated the movement paths of four male and four female elephants with hourly GPS fixes in Tsavo National Park, Kenya in 2012-2013. Consistent with our predictions, the movement paths of elephants had longer step lengths, longer squared net displacements, and were directed towards water sources in the dry season as compared to the wet season. We argue that African elephants know the location of dispersed water resources, enabling them to survive with scarce resources in dry savannas. These results can be used in conservation and management of wildlife, through for instance, protection of preferred water sources.},

abstract = {1. Most studies of animal movements and habitat selection do not recognize empirically that different components of the environment are important to animals at different scales. Often, availability of habitats is defined at one or more arbitrary spatio-temporal scales, but use of those habitats is constrained to one scale. Identification of scalar movement is the first step in developing models to explain why animals select or move to certain parts of their range. We used a non-linear curve-fitting model of movement rates to identify discontinuities in the scales of movement by woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou collared with global positioning system (GPS) collars. 2. We differentiated intrapatch from interpatch movements, but were unable to distinguish interpatch from migratory-type movements for most combinations of individual caribou by season. Model fit was stronger for winter than summer movements. We suggest that increased patch heterogeneity during the winter resulted in interseason variation in movements and corresponding model fit. 3. Responses by caribou to the environment were scale-dependent. When we applied logistic regressions, land-cover type, energetic costs of movement, and predation risk differentiated the two scales of movement. Intrapatch movements had a lower cost of movement, were associated with cover types where foraging behaviours probably occurred, and were closer to areas of higher predator risk than interpatch movements. 4. Application of the non-linear model will aid in developing mechanism-based approaches to studying resource selection and animal behaviour.},

However, mapping cropland extent at finer (e.g., 30-m or finer) spatial resolution over very large areas such as continental, and global extent is challenging. This study developed a precise Landsat 30-m cropland extent map and calculated cropland areas of the Australian continent for the nominal year 2015 using a random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm (MLA) through Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The process involved the use of 8 bands (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, temp, NDVI and NDWI) of Landsat-8 every 16-day data for the years 2014 and 2015. Each band was a composited over 2-4 time-period using mean value compositing. Overall, there was a 48-layer data-cube on which we generated knowledge of croplands versus non-croplands, coded the knowledge into RF MLA and run on the GEE cloud to obtain cropland extent for all of Australia. An external independent evaluation team conducted an accuracy assessment using an independent validation data set collected from field survey and sub-meter to 5-m very high spatial resolution imagery. Results showed an overall accuracy of 97.56{\%} with high producer's accuracy of 98.7{\%} and user's accuracy of 89.0{\%} for the cropland class. The study also determined how the cropland areas change with spatial resolution of imagery at 30-m, 250-m, and 1-km. We established that cropland location precision and map accuracies were significantly higher for 30-m. We also established that areas determined using 30-m were much more precise and reliable.},

abstract = {The elephant with its low surface-to-volume ratio presents an interesting problem concerning heat dissipation. To understand how such large mammals remain in thermal balance, we determined the major avenues of heat loss for an adult African elephant and an immature Indian elephant. Because conventional physiological measurements are difficult for these animals, the present study used a non-invasive technique, infrared thermography, to measure skin temperatures of each elephant. Detailed surface temperature profiles and surface area measurements of each elephant were used in standard equations for convective, conductive and radiant heat transfer. Results demonstrated that heat transfer by free convection and radiation accounted for 86{\%} of the total heat loss for the elephants at EA= 12.6 "C. Heat transfer across the ears, an important thermal window at high ambient temperatures, represented less than 8{\%} of the total heat loss. Surface area of the animals, and metabolic heat production calculated from total heat loss of the African elephant, scaled predictably with body mass. In contrast, the thermal conductance of the elephants (71.6 W / T , African; 84.5 W/"C, Indian) was three to five times higher than predicted from an allometric relationship for smaller mammals. The high thermal conductance of elephants is attributed to the absence of fur and appears to counteract reduced heat transfer associated with a low surface-to-volume ratio.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. Detailed knowledge on movement behaviour of free-ranging muskoxen Ovibos moschatus is currently lacking. Quantifying variation in individual movement and the variables driving such patterns is important to understand how they meet their basic requirements and to inform management. Because mu skoxen exist in nutrient-poor systems with extreme climatic and seasonal variability, individual movement patterns are expected to be largely dependent on environmental conditions and the seasonal variation therein. We analysed high-resolution location data of 14 adult female muskoxen roaming around Zackenberg in northeast Greenland (74°28′N, 20°34′W). We assessed the relative importance (Akaike variable weights) of multiple extrinsic conditions in explaining variation in hourly speed, turning angles, and activity. We found that time of day, ambient temperature, and land cover types were the most important covariates explaining variation in fine-scale movement and activity patterns throughout the year. Movement speeds were consistently lower in land cover types with more dense vegetation. Speed of movement was positively correlated with ambient temperature when the days were long, while negatively related with temperature in periods with few or no hours of daylight. Diurnal peaks in movement and activity patterns were observed most of the year (including mid-winter months with 24-h darkness), except during high-summer (24-h of daylight), when individual movement and activity remained continuously high. The topographic variation (elevation and slope) explained only a small part of the variation in muskox movement patterns in the areas where the muskoxen were observed. Analyses of displacement patterns revealed a mixture of movement behaviours. We conclude that muskoxen in high-arctic Greenland adopt a largely nomadic movement behaviour, but do so within a rather small geographical area (app. 5000 km 2 ), and that their movement and activity patterns are largely directed at finding suitable foraging patches and avoiding cold-stress during harsh winter weather.},

abstract = {Predation risk from lions (Panthera leo) has been linked to habitat characteristics and availability and traits of prey. We separated the effects of vegetation density and the presence of drinking water by analyzing locations of lion kills in relation to rivers with dense vegetation, which offer good lion stalking opportunities, and artificial water points with low vegetation density. The spatial distribution of lion kills was studied at the Klaserie Private Nature Reserve, South Africa. The distance between 215 lion kills and the nearest water source was analyzed using generalized linear models. Lions selected medium-sized prey species. Lion kills were closer to rivers and to artificial water points than expected by random distribution of the kills. Water that attracted prey, and not the vegetation density in riverine areas, increased predation risk, with kills of buffalo (Syncerus caffer), kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), and wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) as water-dependent prey species. Traits of prey species, including feeding type (food habits), digestion type (ruminant or nonruminant), or body size, did not explain locations of lion kills, and no seasonal patterns in lion kills were apparent. We argue that the cascading impact of lions on local mammal assemblages is spatially heterogeneous.},

abstract = {The accuracy of predictive models (also known as mechanistic or causal models) of animal responses to climate change depends on properly incorporating the principles of heat transfer and thermoregulation into those models. Regrettably, proper incorporation of these principles is not always evident. We have revisited the relevant principles of thermal physiology and analysed how they have been applied in predictive models of large mammals, which are particularly vulnerable, to climate change. We considered dry heat exchange, evaporative heat transfer, the thermoneutral zone and homeothermy, and we examined the roles of size and shape in the thermal physiology of large mammals. We report on the following misconceptions in influential predictive models: underestimation of the role of radiant heat transfer, misassignment of the role and misunderstanding of the sustainability of evaporative cooling, misinterpretation of the thermoneutral zone as a zone of thermal tolerance or as a zone of sustainable energetics, confusion of upper critical temperature and critical thermal maximum, overestimation of the metabolic energy cost of evaporative cooling, failure to appreciate that the current advantages of size and shape will become disadvantageous as climate change advances, misassumptions about skin temperature and, lastly, misconceptions about the relationship between body core temperature and its variability with body mass in large mammals. Not all misconceptions invalidate the models, but we believe that preventing inappropriate assumptions from propagating will improve model accuracy, especially as models progress beyond their current typically static format to include genetic and epigenetic adaptation that can result in phenotypic plasticity.},

abstract = {Behavioural thermoregulation is an animal's primary defence against changes in the thermal environment. We aimed to validate a remote technique to quantify the thermal environment behaviourally selected by free-ranging ungulates. First, we demonstrated that the temperature of miniature, 30 mm diameter, black globes (miniglobes) could be converted to standard, 150 mm diameter, black globe temperatures. Miniglobe temperature sensors subsequently were fitted to collars on three free-ranging ungulates, namely blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), impala (Aepyceros melampus) and horse (Equus caballus). Behavioural observations were reflected in animal miniglobe temperatures which differed from those recorded by an identical miniglobe on a nearby exposed weather station. The wildebeest often selected sites protected from the wind, whereas the impala and the horse sheltered from the sun. Nested analysis of variances revealed that the impala and horse selected significantly less variable environments than those recorded at the weather station (P {\textless} 0.001) over a 20-min time interval, whereas, the microclimates selected by wildebeest tended to be more variable (P = 0.08). Correlation of animal miniglobe against weather station miniglobe temperature resulted in regression slopes significantly less than one (P {\textless} 0.001) for all species studied, implying that, overall, the animals selected cooler microclimate s at high environmental heat loads and/or warmer microclimates at low environmental heat loads. We, therefore, have developed an ambulatory device, which can be attached to free-ranging animals, to remotely quantify thermoregulatory behaviour and selected microclimates. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Interaction dynamics revealed how pumas successfully utilized terrain (e.g., fleeing up steep, wooded hillsides) as well as evasive maneuvers (e.g., jumping into trees, running in figure-8 patterns) to increase their escape distance from the overall faster hounds (avg. 2.3× faster). These adaptive strategies were essential to evasion in light of the mean 1.6× higher mass-specific energetic costs of the chase for pumas compared to hounds (mean: 0.76 $\backslash$textlessitalic$\backslash$textgreatervs.$\backslash$textless/italic$\backslash$textgreater 1.29 kJ kg $\backslash$textlesssup$\backslash$textgreater−1$\backslash$textless/sup$\backslash$textgreater min $\backslash$textlesssup$\backslash$textgreater−1$\backslash$textless/sup$\backslash$textgreater , respectively).

abstract = {Physical barriers, such as rivers and roads, constrain the movement of animals, usually by preventing access to adjacent habitats and impeding dispersal. Fences are artificial barriers that are commonly used as a conservation tool to intentionally restrict movements of animals to within protected reserves. However, the potential edge-effect of fences on the behaviour of animals within reserves is poorly understood. We examined the effect of fences on the movement patterns of African elephant (Loxodonta africana), an ecosystem modifier, in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. We used linear and non-linear models to determine the relationship between minimum distance from fence and seasonal daily net displacement of six GPS-collared female elephant. Elephant movement patterns were best explained by a piecewise regression that showed a strong negative relationship between minimum distance from fence and daily net displacement up to a " breakpoint" distance of 2551. m in the dry season and 3829. m in the wet season. The effect of the fence dissipated beyond this distance in both seasons. The increased tortuosity in movement patterns of elephant in the central area of the reserve suggested that they used this area more intensively for foraging compared to the peripheral area, as confirmed by differences in habitat selection. This occurs despite there being no difference in habitat composition between these areas. The decreased use of areas near the fence and more intensive foraging in the central areas constitute an important edge-effect of fences. Since elephant are ecosystem engineers, such edge-effects could potentially cascade throughout the reserve, adversely altering ecologically processes, particularly in reserves with a high edge-to-area ratio. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Resource partitioning among the ungulate species occupying African savanna ecosystems has been well documented in relation to food resources and habitat features, but few studies have addressed how distinctions in surface water dependency contribute to coexistence. During the dry season surface water becomes restricted to a few perennial sources, while the food resources remaining at this time are also most limited in quantity, especially near water where animals congregate to drink. We compared the movement patterns to and from water of sable antelope Hippotragus niger and zebra Equus quagga herds in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. Owing to distinctions in their digestive systems, we expected sable to drink less frequently than zebra, allowing sable to occupy regions further from surface water than zebra. Sable travelled to water at 24-day intervals, versus 12-day intervals for zebra. However, sable travelled c. 25{\%} greater distances to water due to the location of their late dry season home ranges relative to perennial water sources; zebra home ranges were generally closer to water sources. Travelling 1015 km to and from water substantially reduced time spent foraging and resting by both species on days when animals drank. Longer intervals between travel to water by the sable antelope herd enabled it to occupy regions of the landscape further from water than those heavily exploited by the more common grazers during the critical dry season months. By avoiding concentrations of other grazers, the sable also probably gained a reduction in predation risk, balancing the substantial costs in terms of time and energy associated with travel to water. Thereby the distinctions in water dependency of this relatively rare grazer facilitated its coexistence alongside more abundant grazers in the KNP.},

It is now possible to record time-series of animal locations and ancillary data (e.g. activity level derived from on-board accelerometers) over extended areas and long durations with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Such time-series are often piecewise stationary, as the animal may alternate between different stationary phases (i.e. characterised by a specific mean and variance of some key parameter for limited periods). Identifying when these phases start and end is a critical first step to understand the dynamics of the underlying movement processes. We introduce a new segmentation-clustering method we called segclust2d. It can segment bi- (or more generally multi-) variate time-series and possibly cluster the various segments obtained, corresponding to phases assumed to be stationary. It is easy to use, as it only requires specifying the minimum length of a segment (to prevent over-segmentation) based on biological considerations. Although this method can be applied to time-series of any nature, we focus here on two-dimensional piecewise time-series whose phases correspond at small scale to the expressions of different behavioural modes such as transit, feeding and resting, as characterised by two joint metrics such as speed and turning angles or, at larger scale, to temporary home ranges, characterised by stationary distributions of bivariate coordinates. Using computer simulations, we show that segcust2d can rival and even outperform previous, more complex methods, which were specifically developed to highlight changes in movement modes or home range shifts (based on Hidden Markov or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck modelling, respectively), which, contrary to our method, require truly informative initial guesses to be efficient. Furthermore we demonstrate it on actual examples involving a zebra's small scale movements and an elephant's large scale movements, to illustrate the identification of various movement modes and of home range shifts, respectively.},

abstract = {Predation risk from lions (Panthera leo) has been linked to habitat characteristics and availability and traits of prey. We separated the effects of vegetation density and the presence of drinking water by analyzing locations of lion kills in relation to rivers with dense vegetation, which offer good lion stalking opportunities, and artificial water points with low vegetation density. The spatial distribution of lion kills was studied at the Klaserie Private Nature Reserve, South Africa. The distance between 215 lion kills and the nearest water source was analyzed using generalized linear models. Lions selected medium-sized prey species. Lion kills were closer to rivers and to artificial water points than expected by random distribution of the kills. Water that attracted prey, and not the vegetation density in riverine areas, increased predation risk, with kills of buffalo (Syncerus caffer), kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), and wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) as water-dependent prey species. Traits of prey species, including feeding type (food habits), digestion type (ruminant or nonruminant), or body size, did not explain locations of lion kills, and no seasonal patterns in lion kills were apparent. We argue that the cascading impact of lions on local mammal assemblages is spatially heterogeneous.},

We explain the importance of studying development for understanding proximate and ultimate aspects of personality and critically discuss, partly by perhaps provocative statements, our current lack of knowledge and potential approaches to the study of personality development. We first clarify some terminology and argue for a difference between behavioral profiles (BP; at the descriptive level) and personality (at the explanatory level). We then focus on the issue of temporal stability of personality, arguing that based on evolutionary theory, neurophysiological knowledge, and recent findings, personality is probably less stable than often thought. Next we consider the potential influence of genes, discussing gene by environment correlations and interactions and argue that developmental changes in the regulation of DNA expression are probably more relevant than individual differences in DNA sequence.

abstract = {Simple features are a standardized way of encoding spatial vector data (points, lines, polygons) in computers. The sf package implements simple features in R, and has roughly the same capacity for spatial vector data as packages sp, rgeos, and rgdal. We describe the need for this package, its place in the R package ecosystem, and its potential to connect R to other computer systems. We illustrate this with examples of its use. What are simple features? Features can be thought of as "things" or objects that have a spatial location or extent; they may be physical objects like a building, or social conventions like a political state. Feature geometry refers to the spatial properties (location or extent) of a feature, and can be described by a point, a point set, a linestring, a set of linestrings, a polygon, a set of polygons, or a combination of these. The simple adjective of simple features refers to the property that linestrings and polygons are built from points connected by straight line segments. Features typically also have other properties (temporal properties, color, name, measured quantity), which are called feature attributes. Not all spatial phenomena are easy to represent by "things or objects:" continuous phenoma such as water temperature or elevation are better represented as functions mapping from continuous or sampled space (and time) to values (Scheider et al., 2016), and are often represented by raster data rather than vector (points, lines, polygons) data. The sf (Pebesma, 2018) package is an R package for reading, writing, handling, and manipulating simple features in R, reimplementing the vector (points, lines, polygons) data handling functionality of packages sp (Pebesma and Bivand, 2005; Bivand et al., 2013), rgdal (Bivand et al., 2017) and rgeos (Bivand and Rundel, 2017). However, sp has some 400 direct reverse dependencies, and a few thousand indirect ones. Why was there a need to write a package with the potential to replace it? First of all, at the time of writing sp (2003) there was no standard for simple features, and the ESRI shapefile was by far the dominant file format for exchanging vector data. The lack of a clear (open) standard for shapefiles, the omnipresence of "bad" or malformed shapefiles, and the many limitations of the ways it can represent spatial data adversely affected sp, for instance in the way it represents holes in polygons, and a lack of discipline to register holes with their enclosing outer ring. Such ambiguities could influence plotting of data, or communication with other systems or libraries. The simple feature access standard is now widely adopted, but the sp package family has to make assumptions and do conversions to load them into R. This means that you cannot round-trip data, e.g., loading data in R, manipulating them, exporting them and getting the same geometries back. With sf, this is no longer a problem. A second reason was that external libraries heavily used by R packages for reading and writing spatial data (GDAL) and for geometrical operations (GEOS) have developed stronger support for the simple feature standard. A third reason was that the package cluster now known as the tidyverse (Wickham, 2017, 2014), which includes popular packages such as dplyr (Wickham et al., 2017) and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016), does not work well with the spatial classes of sp: • tidyverse packages assume objects not only behave like data.frames (which sp objects do by providing methods), but are data.frames in the sense of being a list with equally sized column vectors, which sp does not do.},

abstract = {Continuous human population expansion pressure on conservation ecosystems restricts wildlife areas, and necessitates active management. In areas of changing land-use and increasing human-animal conflict, responses of wildlife to direct human interventions can inform managers and planners. During August 2004, the boundary fences between Phinda Private Game Reserve and two neighbouring reserves were removed. This study examined behavioural responses of the resident elephants. Older, recently introduced bulls moved into the new area during the first month after fence removal, while younger resident bulls and family groups took between five and eight months. Initially family groups only moved into the new area at night and spent minimal time there, while older bulls spent longer periods of time, regardless of time of day. One year after fence removal, most of the elephants had only expanded their home ranges slightly into the new area. One of the findings of this study is that elephants appear to act cautiously in exploring new areas and responded by moving into the area slowly and over a relatively long time period. This cautious behaviour reduced through time as animals became more familiar with the area. The spatial scale of response of the elephants was relatively small, while the temporal scale of response was relatively large. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The steep terrain and persistent cloud cover pose challenges to robust vegetation and land use mapping. Our objective is to develop satellite image classification techniques that can reliably map forest cover and land use while minimizing the cloud and terrain issues, and provide the basis for long-term monitoring. Multi-seasonal Landsat image composites and elevation ancillary layers effectively minimize the persistent cloud cover and terrain issues. Spectral vegetation index (SVI) products and shade/illumination normalization approaches yield significantly higher mapping accuracies, compared to non-normalized spectral bands. Advanced machine learning image classification routines are implemented through the cloud-based Google Earth Engine platform. Optimal classifier parameters (e.g., number of trees and number of features for random forest classifiers) were achieved by using tuning techniques. Accuracy assessment results indicate consistent and effective overall classification (i.e., above 70{\%} mapping accuracies) can be achieved using multi-temporal SVI composites with simple illumination normalization and elevation ancillary data, despite the fact limited training and reference data are available. This efficient and open-access image analysis workflow provides a reliable methodology to remotely monitor forest cover and land use in FNNR and other mountainous forested, cloud prevalent areas.},

We examine short‐term effects on tree species assemblages and resource utilization by a mesoherbivore and small‐size herbivores (ungulates $\backslash$textless 20 kg) in Sand Forest, after browsing release from a megaherbivore (elephant), or both a mega‐ and mesoherbivore (nyala), respectively. Effects were experimentally separated using replicated exclosures where all trees were counted, identified to species and browsing events recorded. Tree species assemblages were impacted by both elephant and nyala, and by each herbivore species individually. Tree turnover rates were higher where both herbivore species were present than in their combined absence. Diet was segregated among elephant, nyala and small‐size herbivores. Both resource specificity and browsing pressure by nyala increased in absence of elephant; small‐size herbivores increased resource specificity in absence of elephant, and increased browsing pressure in absence of both elephant and nyala. This implies interference competition with competitive release. The indirect effect of the manipulation of herbivore populations, through the removal of one or two herbivore species, caused a shift in tree species composition and diet of smaller‐size herbivores. These indirect effects, especially on tree species composition, can become critical as they affect vegetation dynamics, biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Therefore, in order to conserve habitats and biodiversity across all trophic levels, conservation managers should consider the effects of: (1) the full herbivore assemblage present; and (2) any effects of altering the relative and absolute abundance of different herbivore species on other herbivore species and vegetation.},

abstract = {The behavioural response of animals to unfavourable climatic conditions has received increased attention recently. While many studies have examined the behavioural responses of endotherms to cold temperatures, thermoregulatory behaviour may also occur in response to heat stress. We evaluated whether a heat-sensitive northern ungulate, the moose, Alces alces, showed thermoregulatory behaviour in response to ambient temperature in two populations in southern Norway. We quantified the seasonal habitat use of GPS-collared adult females, as well as fine-scale habitat selection patterns, in relation to time of day and critical temperature thresholds thought to induce heat stress. We also assessed whether temperature-associated changes in spatial behaviour led to a shift in the availability of thermal cover and forage at the chosen location. Frequent exposure to temperatures above critical thresholds occurred in both summer and winter and in both study areas. Moose responded by seeking thermal shelter in mature coniferous forest and avoiding open habitat types, leading to a decrease in local forage availability in summer but not in winter. Differences in habitat choice in response to temperature were most pronounced at twilight. We found that fine-scale habitat selection analyses, using step-selection functions, more effectively revealed thermoregulatory behaviour in both seasons and populations than did habitat use. This is because habitat selection analyses are better able to identify limiting factors operating at different spatiotemporal scales than is habitat use. Our results clearly show that ambient temperature affected fine-scale behavioural decisions of moose with consequences for forage accessibility, especially during summer. As the climate changes, the limiting effect of ambient temperature (cold and high) on animal behaviour is likely to increase, potentially influencing individual fitness and population dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

First, we noticed independent thermal windows, highly vascularised skin areas, on the whole elephants' body and second we observed distinct and sharply delimited hot sections on the elephants' pinnae. The frequency of thermal windows increased with increasing ambient temperature and body weight. We assume that the restriction of an enhanced cutaneous blood flow to thermal windows might enable the animal to react more flexibly to its needs with regard to heat loss. With this understanding, the use of thermal windows in heat loss might be seen as a fine-tuning mechanism under thermoneutral conditions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here, we analyse spatio-temporal dynamics of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in a network of 4000 dry meadows during 21 years. The results demonstrate two strong, related patterns: the amplitude of year-to-year fluctuations in the size of the metapopulation as a whole has increased, though there is no long-term trend in average abundance; and there is a highly significant increase in the level of spatial synchrony in population dynamics. The increased synchrony cannot be explained by increasing within-year spatial correlation in precipitation, the key environmental driver of population change, or in per capita growth rate. On the other hand, the frequency of drought during a critical life-history stage (early larval instars) has increased over the years, which is sufficient to explain the increasing amplitude and the expanding spatial synchrony in metapopulation dynamics. Increased spatial synchrony has the general effect of reducing long-term metapopulation viability even if there is no change in average metapopulation size. This study demonstrates how temporal changes in weather conditions can lead to striking changes in spatio-temporal population dynamics.},

abstract = {Continuous human population expansion pressure on conservation ecosystems restricts wildlife areas, and necessitates active management. In areas of changing land-use and increasing human-animal conflict, responses of wildlife to direct human interventions can inform managers and planners. During August 2004, the boundary fences between Phinda Private Game Reserve and two neighbouring reserves were removed. This study examined behavioural responses of the resident elephants. Older, recently introduced bulls moved into the new area during the first month after fence removal, while younger resident bulls and family groups took between five and eight months. Initially family groups only moved into the new area at night and spent minimal time there, while older bulls spent longer periods of time, regardless of time of day. One year after fence removal, most of the elephants had only expanded their home ranges slightly into the new area. One of the findings of this study is that elephants appear to act cautiously in exploring new areas and responded by moving into the area slowly and over a relatively long time period. This cautious behaviour reduced through time as animals became more familiar with the area. The spatial scale of response of the elephants was relatively small, while the temporal scale of response was relatively large. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The costs and benefits of stalking and chasing
Organisms live under a constant balance between getting and using energy. Large carnivores may feel this balance more acutely because of the large amounts of energy needed to capture and subdue their prey. Williams et al. and Scantlebury et al. used remote measures of physiology and behavior to identify the hunting strategies of the stalking North American puma and the speedy African cheetah (see the Perspective by Laundr{\'{e}}). In both cases the cats' hunting strategies are well matched to produce a balance between the energy they spend on the hunt and the energy they acquire from their prey, despite their very different strategies and levels of competition.
Science, this issue p. 81, p. 79; see also p. 33
Population viability is driven by individual survival, which in turn depends on individuals balancing energy budgets. As carnivores may function close to maximum sustained power outputs, decreased food availability or increased activity may render some populations energetically vulnerable. Prey theft may compromise energetic budgets of mesopredators, such as cheetahs and wild dogs, which are susceptible to competition from larger carnivores. We show that daily energy expenditure (DEE) of cheetahs was similar to size-based predictions and positively related to distance traveled. Theft at 25{\%} only requires cheetahs to hunt for an extra 1.1 hour per day, increasing DEE by just 12{\%}. Therefore, not all mesopredators are energetically constrained by direct competition. Other factors that increase DEE, such as those that increase travel, may be more important for population viability.
Cheetahs' approach to hunting their prey can resist competition from other predators. [Also see Perspective by Laundr{\'{e}}]

abstract = {The loss of apex consumers (large mammals at the top of their food chain) is a major driver of global change [1]. Yet, research on the two main apex consumer guilds, large carnivores [2] and megaherbivores [3], has developed independently, overlooking any potential interactions. Large carnivores provoke behavioral responses in prey [1, 4], driving prey to distribute themselves within a “landscape of fear” [5] and intensify their impacts on lower trophic levels in low-risk areas [6], where they may concentrate nutrients through localized dung deposition [7, 8]. We suggest, however, that megaherbivores modify carnivore-induced trophic cascades. Megaherbivores ($\backslash$textgreater1,000 kg [9]) are largely invulnerable to predation and should respond less to the landscape of fear, thereby counteracting the effects of fear-triggered trophic cascades. By experimentally clearing plots to increase visibility and reduce predation risk, we tested the collective role of both apex consumer guilds in influencing nutrient dynamics in African savanna. We evaluated whether megaherbivores could counteract a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade by redistributing nutrients that accumulate through fear-driven prey aggregations. Our experiment showed that mesoherbivores concentrated fecal nutrients in more open habitat, but that megaherbivores moved nutrients against this fear-driven nutrient accumulation by feeding within the open habitat, yet defecating more evenly across the risk gradient. This work adds to the growing recognition of functional losses that are likely to have accompanied megafaunal extinctions by contributing empirical evidence from one of the last systems with a functionally complete megaherbivore assemblage. Our results suggest that carnivore-induced trophic cascades work differently in a world of giants. le Roux et al. experimentally show how megaherbivores can modify predator-triggered trophic cascades. Where aggregations of fearful prey can lead to fecal nutrient accumulation, megaherbivores redistribute these nutrients away from such predator-maintained biogeochemical hotspots by feeding in areas frequented by prey species but defecating widely.},

abstract = {In predator-free large herbivore populations, where density-dependent feedbacks occur at the limit where forage resources can no longer support the population, environmental catastrophes may play a significant role in population regulation. The potential role of fire as a stochastic mass-mortality event limiting these populations is poorly understood, so too the behavioural and physiological responses of the affected animals to this type of large disturbance event. During September 2005, a wildfire resulted in mortality of 29 (18{\%} population mortality) and injury to 18, African elephants in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. We examined movement and herd association patterns of six GPS-collared breeding herds, and evaluated population physiological response through faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (stress) levels. We investigated population size, structure and projected growth rates using a simulation model. After an initial flight response post-fire, severely injured breeding herds reduced daily displacement with increased daily variability, reduced home range size, spent more time in non-tourist areas and associated less with other herds. Uninjured, or less severely injured, breeding herds also shifted into non-tourist areas post-fire, but in contrast, increased displacement rate (both mean and variability), did not adjust home range size and formed larger herds post-fire. Adult cow stress hormone levels increased significantly post-fire, whereas juvenile and adult bull stress levels did not change significantly. Most mortality occurred to the juvenile age class causing a change in post-fire population age structure. Projected population growth rate remained unchanged at 6.5{\%} p.a., and at current fecundity levels, the population would reach its previous level three to four years post-fire. The natural mortality patterns seen in elephant populations during stochastic events, such as droughts, follows that of the classic mortality pattern seen in predator-free large ungulate populations, i.e. mainly involving juveniles. Fire therefore functions in a similar manner to other environmental catastrophes and may be a natural mechanism contributing to population limitation. Welfare concerns of arson fires, burning during "hot-fire" conditions and the conservation implications of fire suppression (i.e. removal of a potential contributing factor to natural population regulation) should be integrated into fire management strategies for conservation areas.},

abstract = {Manipulations of herbivores in protected areas may have profound effects on ecosystems. We examine short‐term effects on tree species assemblages and resource utilization by a mesoherbivore and small‐size herbivores (ungulates $\backslash$textless 20 kg) in Sand Forest, after browsing release from a megaherbivore (elephant), or both a mega‐ and mesoherbivore (nyala), respectively. Effects were experimentally separated using replicated exclosures where all trees were counted, identified to species and browsing events recorded. Tree species assemblages were impacted by both elephant and nyala, and by each herbivore species individually. Tree turnover rates were higher where both herbivore species were present than in their combined absence. Diet was segregated among elephant, nyala and small‐size herbivores. Both resource specificity and browsing pressure by nyala increased in absence of elephant; small‐size herbivores increased resource specificity in absence of elephant, and increased browsing pressure in absence of both elephant and nyala. This implies interference competition with competitive release. The indirect effect of the manipulation of herbivore populations, through the removal of one or two herbivore species, caused a shift in tree species composition and diet of smaller‐size herbivores. These indirect effects, especially on tree species composition, can become critical as they affect vegetation dynamics, biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Therefore, in order to conserve habitats and biodiversity across all trophic levels, conservation managers should consider the effects of: (1) the full herbivore assemblage present; and (2) any effects of altering the relative and absolute abundance of different herbivore species on other herbivore species and vegetation.},

abstract = {Animal social networks are descriptions of social structure which, aside from their intrinsic interest for understanding sociality, can have significant bearing across many fields of biology. Network analysis provides a flexible toolbox for testing a broad range of hypotheses, and for describing the social system of species or populations in a quantitative and comparable manner. However, it requires careful consideration of underlying assumptions, in particular differentiating real from observed networks and controlling for inherent biases that are common in social data. We provide a practical guide for using this framework to analyse animal social systems and test hypotheses. First, we discuss key considerations when defining nodes and edges, and when designing methods for collecting data. We discuss different approaches for inferring social networks from these data and displaying them. We then provide an overview of methods for quantifying properties of nodes and networks, as well as for testing hypotheses concerning network structure and network processes. Finally, we provide information about assessing the power and accuracy of an observed network. Alongside this manuscript, we provide appendices containing background information on common programming routines and worked examples of how to perform network analysis using the r programming language. We conclude by discussing some of the major current challenges in social network analysis and interesting future directions. In particular, we highlight the under-exploited potential of experimental manipulations on social networks to address research questions.},

abstract = {Daily activity schedules and time budgets reveal how animals cope with changing environmental conditions in securing food and evading enemies. Theory suggests that animals in populations limited by food availability should be energy maximizers in their foraging time allocation, while those regulated by predation should minimize their mobile activity levels. We compared daily and seasonal variation in activity states among three species of grazing ungulates coexisting in the same region of Kruger National Park, South Africa, and for one of these species between regions differing in rainfall. These grazers differed in body size and digestive physiology, potentially affecting their activity patterns. Hourly movement rates recorded by GPS telemetry were partitioned among activity states by applying independent mixture models. All three species showed activity peaks during the early morning and late afternoon, while resting prevailed pre-dawn as well as through midday. African buffalo showed the strongest diel variation in activity and greatest depression of midday activity, consistent with their large body size. Buffalo maintained similar levels of activity through the day and night, while zebra and sable antelope showed higher levels of diurnal than nocturnal activity. During the late dry season, zebra and coexisting sable, but not buffalo, showed elevated foraging and total mobile activity. Zebra devoted more time to foraging than both ruminants, consistent with greater food intake requirements for hindgut digestion. Sable antelope inhabiting the region with higher rainfall showed similar activity levels to the sable herd in the drier area, but slower rates of movement while foraging and travelling and less elevation in foraging time towards the end of the dry season. Observed patterns indicated subtly changing interplay among different constraints bearing on activity patterns over the diel and seasonal cycles, especially those related to digestive physiology. Simplistic concepts of energy maximization or time minimization were not supported.},

abstract = {Patterns of resource selection by animal populations emerge as a result of the behavior of many individuals. Statistical models that describe these population-level patterns of habitat use can miss important interactions between individual animals and characteristics of their local environment; however, identifying these interactions is difficult. One approach to this problem is to incorporate models of individual movement into resource selection models. To do this, we propose a model for step selection functions (SSF) that is composed of a resource-independent movement kernel and a resource selection function (RSF). We show that standard case-control logistic regression may be used to fit the SSF; however, the sampling scheme used to generate control points (i.e., the definition of availability) must be accommodated. We used three sampling schemes to analyze simulated movement data and found that ignoring sampling and the resource-independent movement kernel yielded biased estimates of selection. The level of bias depended on the method used to generate control locations, the strength of selection, and the spatial scale of the resource map. Using empirical or parametric methods to sample control locations produced biased estimates under stronger selection; however, we show that the addition of a distance function to the analysis substantially reduced that bias. Assuming a uniform availability within a fixed buffer yielded strongly biased selection estimates that could be corrected by including the distance function but remained inefficient relative to the empirical and parametric sampling methods. As a case study, we used location data collected from elk in Yellowstone National Park, USA, to show that selection and bias may be temporally variable. Because under constant selection the amount of bias depends on the scale at which a resource is distributed in the landscape, we suggest that distance always be included as a covariate in SSF analyses. This approach to modeling resource selection is easily implemented using common statistical tools and promises to provide deeper insight into the movement ecology of animals.},

abstract = {A central question in the study of predator-prey relationships is to what extent prey behaviour is determined by avoidance of predators. Here, we test whether the long-term risk of encountering lions and the presence of lions in the vicinity influence the behaviour of large African herbivores at waterholes through avoidance of high-risk areas, increases in group size, changes in temporal niche or changes in the time spent in waterhole areas. In Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we monitored waterholes to study the behaviour of nine herbivore species under different risks of encountering lions. We radio-collared 26 lions in the study area which provided the opportunity to monitor whether lions were present during observation sessions and to map longer-term seasonal landscapes of risk of encountering lions. Our results show that the preferred prey species for lions (buffalo, kudu and giraffe) avoided risky waterholes. Group size increased as encounter risk increased for only two species (wildebeest and zebra), but this effect was not strong. Interestingly, buffalo avoided the hours of the day which are dangerous when the long-term and short-term risks of encountering lions were high, and all species showed avoidance of waterhole use at night times when lions were in the vicinity. This illustrates well how prey can make temporal adjustments to avoid dangerous periods coinciding with predator hunting. Additionally, many herbivores spent more time accessing water to drink when the long- and short-term risks of encountering lions were high, and they showed longer potential drinking time when the long-term risk of encountering lions was high, suggesting higher levels of vigilance. This study illustrates the diversity of behavioural adjustments to the risk of encountering a predator and how prey respond differently to temporal variations in this risk. ¬{\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2009.},

However, current ungulate management ignores the role of nonlethal risk effects of predation. We introduce the concept of ‘hunting for fear' as an extension of the more classical ‘hunting to kill' that is typically used in large herbivore management. Hunting for fear aims to induce a behavioural response in ungulates, for example, as a way of diverting them from areas where their impact is undesired. Synthesis and applications. Hunting for fear asks for novel, potentially controversial, ways of hunting to induce strong enough risk effects, including more hunting on foot and with dogs, extended hunting seasons (ideally year-round) and increased hunting of calves. Hunting for fear may offer novel opportunities to help manage the growing human–wildlife conflicts that we experience globally.},

abstract = {The IUCN Redlist considers the African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) to be "vulnerable" despite it numbering in the 100,000s and having a large geographical range. This seeming paradox stems from how quickly human persecution can eliminate elephants across large areas and how quickly elephant numbers can increase when protected. Much elephant research concentrates on the extent and consequences of elephant persecution. Where elephants thrive, two other human interventions, the provision of artificial water and the construction of fences may have large, and perhaps unintended, impacts on elephant behavior. In general, successful management requires that we understand elephant movements and land-use choices across large areas and long periods. Here, we ask specifically how artificial water and fences might affect these movements. To do this, we first characterize how elephants move in different seasons and landscape types, in different years, and how these patterns change over a region that varies considerably in annual rainfall. We fitted 73 elephants with GPS collars across a large rainfall gradient spanning seven southern African countries over a period of 6 years. We analyzed remotely-sensed environmental data from four satellite borne sensors that measure daily rainfall, weekly temperature, bi-monthly greenness, and summarise human infrastructure. Elephants move approximately 6 km/day in dry landscapes, down to approximately 3 km/day in the wettest ones. Strong seasonal differences modulate geographic differences. Elephants move less, cover less area, and are more faithful to landscapes across years in the dry season than the wet. Water availability drives these seasonal patterns. Seasonal differences in the area covered are less pronounced in wet landscapes where permanent water is more dispersed. Within-day movements reveal that elephants are consistently crepuscular but more active at night than midday when temperatures are high. Direction-changes are centered at midnight when elephants are close to water indicating regular nighttime treks to water. By design, our analyses seek to find general patterns of elephant movements - something that one can achieve only across a large range of locations and ecological conditions - in order to understand the impact of human interventions. We show that both interventions reduce seasonal differences in elephant ranging patterns and increase local impacts of elephants on the vegetation. Artificial water sources allow more extensive dry season ranging, allowing elephants to use - and potentially overexploit - vegetation in areas that would have be otherwise inaccessible to them except in the wet season. Fences cause elephants to "bunch-up" against them during the wet season, again locally increasing the pressure elephants put on their resources. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Movement influences a myriad of ecological processes operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Yet our understanding of animal movement is limited by the resolution of data that can be obtained from individuals. Traditional approaches implicitly assume that movement decisions are made at the spatial and temporal scales of observation, although this scale is typically an artifact of data-gathering technology rather than biological realism. To address this limitation, we used telemetry-based movement data for caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in Newfoundland, Canada, and compared movement decisions estimated at the temporal resolution of GPS relocations (2 hours) to a novel model describing directional movement to areas reachable over an extended period. We showed that this newer model is a better predictor of movement decisions by caribou, with decisions made at the scale of ∼2 km, including the strong avoidance of dense coniferous forest, an outcome not detectable at the scale of GPS relocations. These results illustrate the complexity of factors affecting animal movement decisions and the analytical challenges associated with their interpretation. Our novel modelling framework will help support increased accuracy in predictive models of animal space-use, and thereby aid in determining biologically meaningful scales for collecting movement and habitat data.},

abstract = {We used miniature data loggers implanted in the abdominal cavity to measure core body temperatures at 30 min intervals in eight (three males, five females) adult free-ranging springbok Antidorcas marsupialis in their natural habitat, over a period of 11-13 months. The animals were subjected to a nychthemeral range of air temperature that often exceeded 20 degrees C, with an absolute minimum temperature of -6 degrees C and a maximum of 34 degrees C. Abdominal temperature exhibited a low amplitude (approximately 1.2 degrees C) nychthemeral rhythm, with a temperature peak near sunset and a trough shortly after sunrise. The amplitude of the nychthemeral rhythm of body temperature was not correlated with the 24 h range of air temperature. Although mean 24 h body temperatures were positively correlated with corresponding air temperatures, mean daily body temperature increased, on average, by only 0.02 degrees C per 1 degrees C increase in air temperature, so that it was only approximately 0.3 degrees C higher in summer than in winter. Mean monthly body temperatures were strongly positively correlated with photoperiod and, in parallel with changes in the time of sunrise, the times at which the minimum and maximum body temperatures occurred were shifted approximately 1.2 h earlier in summer than in winter. Annual and daily variations in body temperature of springbok, like those of other free-living African ungulates, therefore appear to reflect an endogenous rhythm, entrained by the light:dark cycle, but largely independent of fluctuations in the environmental thermal load. Springbok exhibit remarkable homeothermy and do not employ adaptive heterothermy to survive in their natural environment.},

abstract = {Animals frequently exhibit consistent among-individual differences in behavioural and physiological traits that are inherently flexible. Why should individuals differ consistently in their expression of labile traits? Recently, positive feedbacks between state and behaviour have been proposed as a possible explanation for the maintenance of consistent among-individual differences in both state and behaviour. If state affects behaviour, and behaviour reciprocally affects state, then differences in either state or behaviour that arise among individuals even by chance could be maintained over extended periods of time. We tested for positive feedbacks experimentally using wild-caught red knots (Calidris canutus islandica). In the wild, knots exhibit consistent among-individual differences in digestive physiology (the mass of the muscular part of the stomach, the gizzard) and foraging behaviour (diet), two inherently labile traits. Experimentally manipulated diet quality had a large effect on gizzard mass. Experimentally manipulated gizzard mass reciprocally influenced total food eaten during ad libitum trials. The effect of gizzard mass on diet choice, though in the predicted direction, was not statistically significant. Individuals exhibited consistent differences in foraging behaviour of unknown origin independent of current gizzard mass, as well as large residual unexplained variance in foraging behaviour. These two sources of variation in foraging behaviour overruled the gizzard mass-dependent foraging behaviour and hence eroded the treatment-related differences in gizzard mass. We conclude that positive feedbacks between diet choice and gizzard mass play at best a limited role in maintaining among-individual variation in gizzard mass in red knots. Furthermore, we suggest that many models of state–behaviour feedbacks likely overestimate their potential importance in maintaining long-term among-individual variation in labile traits because most models of state–behaviour feedbacks fail to account for the effects of additional factors that may act to disrupt the feedback loops. The among-individual differences in diet choice observed during solitary foraging trials eroded the consistent among-individual differences in gizzard mass observed following periods of staple diet treatments in which knots foraged in social groups. Social foraging interactions may play an important role determining the expression of foraging behaviours such as intake rate that in turn influence gizzard mass. Further studies are needed to experimentally test the role of social interactions as a mechanism generating consistent among-individual differences in foraging behaviours and gizzard mass. A lay summary is available for this article.},

However, its biological implications, both for thermoregulation as well as for the evolution of epidermal structures, have not yet been noted. Since early epidermal structures are poorly preserved in the fossil record, we study modern elephants to infer not only the heat transfer effect of present-day sparse hair, but also its potential evolutionary origins. Here we use a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches, and a range of hair densities determined from photographs, to test whether sparse hairs increase convective heat loss from elephant skin, thus serving an intentional evolutionary purpose. Our conclusion is that elephants are covered with hair that significantly enhances their thermoregulation ability by over 5{\%} under all scenarios considered, and by up to 23{\%} at low wind speeds where their thermoregulation needs are greatest. The broader biological significance of this finding suggests that maintaining a low-density hair cover can be evolutionary purposeful and beneficial, which is consistent with the fact that elephants have the greatest need for heat loss of any modern terrestrial animal because of their high body-volume to skin-surface ratio. Elephant hair is the first documented example in nature where increasing heat transfer due to a low hair density covering may be a desirable effect, and therefore raises the possibility of such a covering for similarly sized animals in the past. This elephant example dispels the widely-held assumption that in modern endotherms body hair functions exclusively as an insulator and could therefore be a first step to resolving the prior paradox of why hair was able to evolve in a world much warmer than our own.},

abstract = {The internal state of an individual-as it relates to thirst, hunger, fear, or reproductive drive-can be inferred by referencing points on its movement path to external environmental and sociological variables. Using time-series approaches to characterize autocorrelative properties of step-length movements collated every 3 h for seven free-ranging African elephants, we examined the influence of social rank, predation risk, and seasonal variation in resource abundance on periodic properties of movement. The frequency domain methods of Fourier and wavelet analyses provide compact summaries of temporal autocorrelation and show both strong diurnal and seasonal based periodicities in the step-length time series. This autocorrelation is weaker during the wet season, indicating random movements are more common when ecological conditions are good. Periodograms of socially dominant individuals are consistent across seasons, whereas subordinate individuals show distinct differences diverging from that of dominants during the dry season. We link temporally localized statistical properties of movement to landscape features and find that diurnal movement correlation is more common within protected wildlife areas, and multiday movement correlations found among lower ranked individuals are typically outside of protected areas where predation risks are greatest. A frequency-related spatial analysis of movement-step lengths reveal that rest cycles related to the spatial distribution of critical resources (i.e., forage and water) are responsible for creating the observed patterns. Our approach generates unique information regarding the spatial-temporal interplay between environmental and individual characteristics, providing an original approach for understanding the movement ecology of individual animals and the spatial organization of animal populations.},

abstract = {Seasonal fluctuations in water availability cause predictable changes in the profitability of habitats in tropical ecosystems, and animals evolve adaptive behavioural and spatial responses to these fluctuations. However, stochastic changes in the distribution and abundance of surface water between years can alter resource availability at a landscape scale, causing shifts in animal behaviour. In the Okavango Delta, Botswana, a flood-pulsed ecosystem, the volume of water entering the system doubled between 2008 and 2009, creating a sudden change in the landscape. We used African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) to test the hypotheses that seasonal habitat selection would be related to water availability, that increased floodwater levels would decrease forage abundance and affect habitat selection, and that this would decrease buffalo resting time, reduce reproductive success and decrease body condition. Buffalo selected contrasting seasonal habitats, using habitats far from permanent water during the rainy season and seasonally-flooded habitats close to permanent water during the early and late flood seasons. The 2009 water increase reduced forage availability in seasonally-flooded habitats, removing a resource buffer used by the buffalo during the late flood season, when resources were most limited. In response, buffalo used drier habitats in 2009, although there was no significant change in the time spent moving or resting, or daily distance moved. While their reproductive success decreased in 2009, body condition increased. A protracted period of high water levels could prove detrimental to herbivores, especially to smaller-bodied species that require high quality forage. Stochastic annual fluctuations in water levels, predicted to increase as a result of anthropogenically-induced climate change, are likely to have substantial impacts on the functioning of water-driven tropical ecosystems, affecting environmental conditions within protected areas. Buffer zones around critical seasonal resources are essential to allow animals to engage in compensatory behavioural and spatial mechanisms in response to changing environmental conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The identification of temporal thresholds or shifts in animal movement informs ecologists of changes in an animal's behaviour, which contributes to an understanding of species' responses in different environments. In African savannas, rainfall, temperature and primary productivity influence the movements of large herbivores and drive changes at different scales. Here, we developed a novel approach to define seasonal shifts in movement behaviour by examining the movements of a highly mobile herbivore (elephant; Loxodonta africana), in relation to local and regional rainfall patterns.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used speed to determine movement changes of between 8 and 14 GPS-collared elephant cows, grouped into five spatial clusters, in Kruger National Park, South Africa. To detect broad-scale patterns of movement, we ran a three-year daily time-series model for each individual (2007-2009). Piecewise regression models provided the best fit for elephant movement, which exhibited a segmented, waveform pattern over time. Major breakpoints in speed occurred at the end of the dry and wet seasons of each year. During the dry season, female elephant are constrained by limited forage and thus the distances they cover are shorter and less variable. Despite the inter-annual variability of rainfall, speed breakpoints were strongly correlated with both local and regional rainfall breakpoints across all three years. Thus, at a multi-year scale, rainfall patterns significantly affect the movements of elephant. The variability of both speed and rainfall breakpoints across different years highlights the need for an objective definition of seasonal boundaries.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: By using objective criteria to determine behavioural shifts, we identified a biologically meaningful indicator of major changes in animal behaviour in different years. We recommend the use of such criteria, from an animal's perspective, for delineating seasons or other extrinsic shifts in ecological studies, rather than arbitrarily fixed definitions based on convention or common practice.},

abstract = {To understand the adaptive capacity of a species in response to rapid habitat destruction and climate change, we investigated variation in body temperature (Tb) of three species of antelope, namely eland, blue wildebeest and impala, using abdominally-implanted temperature data loggers. The study was conducted at two climatically contrasting environments in South Africa, one with a less seasonal and mild winter (Mapungubwe National Park) and the other with a more seasonal, long and cold winter (Asante Sana Game Reserve). Since the habitat with long and cold winters would be suboptimal for these African antelopes, which evolved in less seasonal and hot environments, antelopes in Asante Sana were expected to exhibit a larger amplitude in Tband a lower minimum body temperature (MinTb) during winter to reduce Tband the ambient temperature (Tb-Ta) gradient to save energy. In both eland and impala, 24-h body temperature amplitude did not differ between the study sites, regardless of season. Conversely, wildebeest in Mapungubwe showed a higher variability in the 24-h amplitude of body temperature and also a lower MinTbduring winter and spring than the wildebeest in Asante Sana. This variation in Tbamong Mapungubwe wildebeest was influenced by both the amplitude of ambient temperature (positive) and cumulative rainfall (negative), which was not the case for wildebeest in Asante Sana. We propose that the low MinTbof wildebeest in Mapungubwe was the result of nutritional stress during winter and spring; an evident response even during a year of average rainfall. Therefore, these wildebeest apparently live in a physiologically stressful environment. With the predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of drought periods in southern Africa, wildebeest and other grazers, will likely experience greater nutritional stress in the future. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The elk or wapiti (Cervus elaphus) and bison (Bison bison) of Yellowstone National Park have lived in an environment free of wolves (Canis lupus) for the last 50 years. In the winter of 1994-1995, wolves were reintroduced into parts of Yellowstone National Park. Foraging theory predicts that elk and bison would respond to this threat by increasing their vigilance levels. We tested this prediction by comparing vigilance levels of elk and bison in areas with wolves with those of elk still in "wolf-free" zones of the Park. Male elk and bison showed no response to the reintroduction of wolves, maintaining the lowest levels of vigilance throughout the study (approximate to 12 and 7{\%} of the time was spent vigilant, respectively). Female elk and bison showed significantly higher vigilance levels in areas with wolves than in areas without wolves. The highest vigilance level (47.5 +/- 4.1{\%}; mean +/- SE) was seen by the second year for female elk with calves in the areas with wolves and was maintained during the subsequent 3 years of the study. As wolves expanded into non-wolf areas, female elk with and without calves in these areas gradually increased their vigilance levels from initially 20.1 +/- 3.5 and 11.5 +/- 0.9{\%} to 43.0 +/- 5.9 and 30.5 +/- 2.8{\%} by the fifth year of the study, respectively. We discuss the possible reasons for the differences seen among the social groups. We suggest that these behavioural responses to the presence of wolves may have more far-reaching consequences for elk and bison ecology than the actual killing of individuals by wolves.},

abstract = {Wildlife populations occur in increasingly fragmented landscapes, making corridor ecology important to conservation managers. Human disturbance has been identified as a proximate cause of limiting corridor use or increasing streaking behavior by wild elephants, but there are likely to be physiological triggers that directly initiate these risk averse behaviors. We simultaneously monitored elephant stress hormone concentrations and movement in two reserves to test whether elephants in an elevated physiological state restricted use of corridors, or, if they still used corridors, exhibited relatively rapid unidirectional movements indicative of streaking behavior. Contrary to predictions, the elephant population in an elevated physiological state did not reduce use of corridors between core areas. However, as predicted, when the population was in an elevated physiological state, elephant family groups exhibited less tortuosity, and moved 77{\%} faster when in corridors as opposed to core areas, compared to only a 20{\%} difference between corridor and core area speed when not in an elevated physiological state. Rapid movement along corridors by elephants in elevated physiological states is likely an adaptive behavioral response to avoid further exposure to stressors. Furthermore, because chronically stressed elephants can be more aggressive towards humans, understanding when and where elephants exhibit streaking behavior can guide human-elephant conflict mitigation. We demonstrate that corridor use can exist at relatively fine spatial scales within fenced reserves, and the persistent use of corridors regardless of physiological state suggests that they are likely an important, but neglected, component of animal spatial ecology within reserves. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Gigantic size presents both opportunities and challenges in thermoregulation. Allometric scaling relationships suggest that gigantic animals have difficulty dissipating metabolic heat. Large body size permits the maintenance of fairly constant core body temperatures in ectothermic animals by means of gigantothermy. Conversely, gigantothermy combined with endothermic metabolic rate and activity likely results in heat production rates that exceed heat loss rates. In tropical environments, it has been suggested that a substantial rate of heat storage might result in a potentially lethal rise in core body temperature in both elephants and endothermic dinosaurs. However, the behavioral choice of nocturnal activity might reduce heat storage. We sought to test the hypothesis that there is a functionally significant relationship between heat storage and locomotion in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), and model the thermoregulatory constraints on activity in elephants and a similarly sized migratory dinosaur, Edmontosaurus. Pre- and post-exercise (N=37 trials) measurements of core body temperature and skin temperature, using thermography were made in two adult female Asian elephants at the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans, LA, USA. Over ambient air temperatures ranging from 8 to 34.5°C, when elephants exercised in full sun, {\~{}}56 to 100{\%} of active metabolic heat production was stored in core body tissues. We estimate that during nocturnal activity, in the absence of solar radiation, between 5 and 64{\%} of metabolic heat production would be stored in core tissues. Potentially lethal rates of heat storage in active elephants and Edmontosaurus could be behaviorally regulated by nocturnal activity.},

abstract = {Body size is a fundamental trait known to allometrically scale with metabolic rate, and therefore a key determinant of individual development, life history and consequently fitness. In spatially structured environments, movement is an equally important driver of fitness. Because movement is tightly coupled with body size, we expect habitat fragmentation to induce a strong selection pressure on size variation across and within species. Changes in body size distributions are then, in turn, expected to alter food web dynamics. However, no consensus has been reached on how spatial isolation and resource growth affect body size distributions. Our aim was to investigate how these two factors shape the body size distribution of consumers under scenarios of size-dependent and -independent consumer movement by applying a mechanistic, individual-based resource-consumer model. The outcome was then linked to important ecosystem traits such as resource abundance and stability. Finally, we determined those factors that explain most variation in size distributions. We demonstrate that decreasing connectivity and resource growth select for communities (or populations) consisting of larger species (or individuals) due to strong selection for the ability to move over longer distances. When including size-dependent movement, moderate levels of connectivity result in increases in local size diversity. Due to this elevated functional diversity, resource uptake is optimized at the metapopulation or metacommunity level. At these intermediate levels of connectivity, size-dependent movement explains most of the observed variation in size distributions. Interestingly, local and spatial stability of consumer biomass are lowest when isolation and resource productivity are high. Finally, we highlight that size-dependent movement is of vital importance for the survival of populations within highly fragmented landscapes. Our results demonstrate that considering size-dependent movement and resource growth is essential to understand patterns of size distributions at the population or community level and the resulting metapopulation or metacommunity dynamics.},

abstract = {Heat stress can limit the activity time budget of ungulates due to hyperthermia, which is relevant for African antelopes in ecosystems where temperature routinely increases above 40 °C. Body size influences this thermal sensitivity as large bodied ungulates have a lower surface area to volume ratio than smaller ungulates, and therefore a reduced heat dissipation capacity. We tested whether the activity pattern during the day of three antelope species of different body size—eland, blue wildebeest and impala—is negatively correlated with the pattern of black globe tem- perature (BGT) during the day of the ten hottest days and each season in a South African semi-arid ecosystem. Fur- thermore, we tested whether the larger bodied eland and wildebeest are less active than the smaller impala during the hottest days and seasons. Our results show that indeed BGT was negatively correlated with the diurnal activity of eland, wildebeest and impala, particularly during summer. During spring, only the activity of the larger bodied eland and wildebeest was negatively influenced by BGT, but not for the smallest of the three species, the impala. We argue that spring, with its high heat stress, coupled with poor forage and water availability, could be critical for survival of these large African antelopes. Our study contributes to understanding how endothermic animals can cope with extreme climatic conditions, which are expected to occur more frequently due to climate change.},

@article{Stelzner1988,
abstract = {This paper examines the effect of thermal environment on movement patterns of free-ranging yellow baboons (Papio cynocephalus). For Amboseli baboons, one source of potential thermal stress is intense midday heat, and a plausible thermoregulatory response is for animals to simply move into the shade. I therefore examined the hypothesis that baboons would choose quadrats with higher shade availability (as measured by vegetation cover) in response to increasing midday heat loads (as measured by air temperature and solar radiation). Surprisingly, this was not the case—neither ambient air temperature, ambient solar radiation, nor quadrat plant species composition had a significant effect on shade availability of quadrat selected. Instead, thermal conditions affected a different aspect of baboon movements; namely, spatial displacement rates. At high air temperatures, baboons as a group traversed woodland habitats more slowly, and bare pans more quickly, than at lower air temperatures. I surmised that this relationship might reflect thermal effects on movement patterns at a smaller scale: if individuals exposed to high heat loads spent more time resting in shade under clumps of vegetation, they would thereby traverse densely-vegetated (hence shaded) quadrats more slowly. To address this question directly, I obtained focal sample data on activity and microhabitat budgets of individual baboons in relation to environmental temperature. The frequency of most combinations of activity state (e.g., grooming, social behavior) and microenvironment state (e.g., elevation, proximity to vegetation) did not vary monotonically with air temperature. However, baboons in shaded locations (but not those in unshaded locations) spent more time resting and less time moving at high air temperatures than low. In other words, baboon activity budgets depended on both microclimate and microhabitat—animals reduced their activity, particularly movement, when they encountered shade under hot conditions. This pattern of microhabitat choice in turn led to temperature-dependent changes in travel rate at the habitat level. These observational studies of movement patterns suggest that Amboseli baboons employ opportunistic thermoregulation—they do not seek out densely-shaded habitats or individual patches of shade at high air temperatures. Instead, they respond to environmental heat loads by resting, and thereby slowing down, when they happen to encounter plant shade. Aspects of baboon ecology that favor such an opportunistic mode of thermoregulation include large body size and non-thermal constraints on movement patterns.},

abstract = {Measurement of the time allocation of penguins at sea has been a major goal of researchers in recent years. Until now, however, no equipment has been available that would allow measurement of the aquatic and terrestrial behaviour of an Antarctic penguin while it is commuting between the colony and the foraging grounds. A new motion detector, based on the measurement of acceleration, has been used here in addition to current methods of inferring behaviour using data loggers that monitor depth and speed. We present data on the time allocation of Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) according to the different types of behaviours they display during their foraging trips: walking, tobogganing, standing on land, lying on land, resting at the water surface, porpoising and diving. To illustrate the potential of this new technique, we compared the behaviour of Ad{\'{e}}lie penguins during the chick-rearing period in a fast sea-ice region and an ice-free region. The proportion of time spent standing, lying on land and walking during foraging trips was greater for penguins in the sea-ice region (37.6+/-13.3{\%} standing, 21.6+/-15.6{\%} lying and 5.9+/-6.3{\%} walking) than for those in the ice-free region (12.0+/-15.8 {\%} standing, 0.38+/-0.60{\%} lying and 0 {\%} walking), whereas the proportion of time spent resting at the water surface and porpoising was greater for birds in the ice-free region (38.1+/-6.4{\%} resting and 1.1+/-1.1{\%} porpoising) than for those in the sea-ice region (3.0+/-2.3{\%} resting and 0{\%} porpoising; means +/- s.d., N=7 for the sea-ice region, N=4 for the ice-free region). Using this new approach, further studies combining the monitoring of marine resources in different Antarctic sites and the measurement of the energy expenditure of foraging penguins, e.g. using heart rates, will constitute a powerful tool for investigating the effects of environmental conditions on their foraging strategy. This technique will expand our ability to monitor many animals in the field.},

abstract = {Temperature profoundly influences physiological responses in animals, primarily due to the effects on biochemical reaction rates. Since physiological responses are often exemplified by their rate dependency (e.g., rate of blood flow, rate of metabolism, rate of heat production, and rate of ion pumping), the study of temperature adaptations has a long history in comparative and evolutionary physiology. Animals may either defend a fairly constant temperature by recruiting biochemical mechanisms of heat production and utilizing physiological responses geared toward modifying heat loss and heat gain from the environment, or utilize biochemical modifications to allow for physiological adjustments to temperature. Biochemical adaptations to temperature involve alterations in protein structure that compromise the effects of increased temperatures on improving catalytic enzyme function with the detrimental influences of higher temperature on protein stability. Temperature has acted to shape the responses of animal proteins in manners that generally preserve turnover rates at animals' normal, or optimal, body temperatures. Physiological responses to cold and warmth differ depending on whether animals maintain elevated body temperatures (endothermic) or exhibit minimal internal heat production (ectothermic). In both cases, however, these mechanisms involve regulated neural and hormonal over heat flow to the body or heat flow within the body. Examples of biochemical responses to temperature in endotherms involve metabolic uncoupling mechanisms that decrease metabolic efficiency with the outcome of producing heat, whereas ectothermic adaptations to temperature are best exemplified by the numerous mechanisms that allow for the tolerance or avoidance of ice crystal formation at temperatures below 0 • C.

abstract = {Animals frequently exhibit consistent among-individual differences in behavioural and physiological traits that are inherently flexible. Why should individuals differ consistently in their expression of labile traits? Recently, positive feedbacks between state and behaviour have been proposed as a possible explanation for the maintenance of consistent among-individual differences in both state and behaviour. If state affects behaviour, and behaviour reciprocally affects state, then differences in either state or behaviour that arise among individuals even by chance could be maintained over extended periods of time. We tested for positive feedbacks experimentally using wild-caught red knots (Calidris canutus islandica). In the wild, knots exhibit consistent among-individual differences in digestive physiology (the mass of the muscular part of the stomach, the gizzard) and foraging behaviour (diet), two inherently labile traits. Experimentally manipulated diet quality had a large effect on gizzard mass. Experimentally manipulated gizzard mass reciprocally influenced total food eaten during ad libitum trials. The effect of gizzard mass on diet choice, though in the predicted direction, was not statistically significant. Individuals exhibited consistent differences in foraging behaviour of unknown origin independent of current gizzard mass, as well as large residual unexplained variance in foraging behaviour. These two sources of variation in foraging behaviour overruled the gizzard mass-dependent foraging behaviour and hence eroded the treatment-related differences in gizzard mass. We conclude that positive feedbacks between diet choice and gizzard mass play at best a limited role in maintaining among-individual variation in gizzard mass in red knots. Furthermore, we suggest that many models of state–behaviour feedbacks likely overestimate their potential importance in maintaining long-term among-individual variation in labile traits because most models of state–behaviour feedbacks fail to account for the effects of additional factors that may act to disrupt the feedback loops. The among-individual differences in diet choice observed during solitary foraging trials eroded the consistent among-individual differences in gizzard mass observed following periods of staple diet treatments in which knots foraged in social groups. Social foraging interactions may play an important role determining the expression of foraging behaviours such as intake rate that in turn influence gizzard mass. Further studies are needed to experimentally test the role of social interactions as a mechanism generating consistent among-individual differences in foraging behaviours and gizzard mass.

We analyzed poaching risk for African elephant (Loxodonta africana) by comparing spatial and non-spatial Bayesian models. Reports on elephant poaching in the Tsavo ecosystem were obtained for 2002⿿2012 from the Kenya Wildlife Service. The ecosystem was divided into 34 spatial units for which poaching data were aggregated and served as the base units for analysis. Spatial and non-spatial Bayesian models were fed with expert knowledge obtained through survey responses from 30 experts. The predictive accuracy of both models was assessed using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC). Our results indicated that spatial Bayesian modeling improved the model fit for mapping elephant poaching risk compared to using non-spatial Bayesian models (DIC value of 193.05 vs 199.03). The results further showed that the seasonal timing of elephant poaching (i.e., in dry and wet seasons), density of waterholes, livestock density and elephant population density were factors significantly influencing the spatial patterns of elephant poaching risk in the Tsavo ecosystem for both models. Although there were similarities in the high risk areas for elephant poaching recognized in both models, risk probability values per spatial unit could differ. Furthermore, spatial Bayesian modeling also identified areas of high poaching risk that were not predicted by the non-spatial model. These findings provide vital information for identifying priority areas for combating elephant poaching and for informing conservation management decisions. The model we present here can be applied to poaching data for other threatened species.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we discuss the links between evolutionary game theory and personality research. Evolutionary game theory is a set of research methods used to investigate the evolution of social behavior, whereas personality research is mainly focused on comprehensively describing individual differences and their correlates. Until recently, these research domains developed independently, and scholars from one domain only scarcely referred to insights obtained in the other domain. This is changing, however, due to two developments. First, models of evolutionary game theory reveal that personality differences may have an adaptive explanation. These models generate new insights into the origins of personality, and some of these models produce novel and testable hypotheses. Second, it is becoming clear that individual differences matter for the course and outcome of evolution. Accordingly, insights from evolutionary game theory (and experiments based on these insights) can be misleading if personality differences are neglected. Here, we review these recent developments, emphasizing both the evolutionary causes and the evolutionary consequences of personality differences. Overall, we argue that the behavioral sciences would profit from a closer integration of mechanistic and functional perspectives.},

Therefore, we identified priority areas for the conservation of mammalian carnivores, while accounting for species-specific requirements for connectivity and expected agricultural and urban expansion. While prioritizing for carnivores only, we were also able to test their effectiveness as surrogates for 23,110 species of amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles and 867 terrestrial ecoregions. We then assessed the risks to carnivore conservation within each country that makes a contribution to global carnivore conservation. We found that land use change will potentially lead to important range losses, particularly amongst already threatened carnivore species. In addition, the 17{\%} of land targeted for protection under the Aichi Target 11 was found to be inadequate to conserve carnivores under expected land use change. Our results also highlight that land use change will decrease the effectiveness of carnivores to protect other threatened species, especially threatened amphibians. In addition, the risk of human-carnivore conflict is potentially high in countries where we identified spatial priorities for their conservation. As meeting the global biodiversity target will be inadequate for carnivore protection, innovative interventions are needed to conserve carnivores outside protected areas to compliment any proposed expansion of the protected area network.},

abstract = {Communication is a process in which senders provide information via signals and receivers respond accordingly. This process relies on two coevolving conventions: a “sender code” that determines what kind of signal is to be sent given the sender's state; and a “receiver code” that determines the appropriate responses to different signal types. By means of a simple but generic model, we show that polymorphic sender and receiver strategies emerge naturally during the evolution of communication, and that the number of alternative strategies observed at equilibrium depends on the potential for error in signal production. Our model suggests that alternative communication strategies will evolve whenever senders possess imperfect information about their own quality or state, signals are costly, and genetic mechanisms allow for a correlation between sender and receiver behavior. These findings provide an explanation for recent reports of individual differences in communication strategies, and suggest that the amount of individual variation that can be expected in communication systems depends on the type of information being conveyed. Our model also suggests a link between communication and the evolution of animal personalities, which is that individual differences in the production and interpretation of signals can result in consistent differences in behavior.},

abstract = {Detailed observation of the movement of individual animals offers the potential to understand spatial population processes as the ultimate consequence of individual behaviour, physiological constraints and fine-scale environmental influences. However, movement data from individuals are intrinsically stochastic and often subject to severe observation error. Linking such complex data to dynamical models of movement is a major challenge for animal ecology. Here, we review a statistical approach, state–space modelling, which involves changing how we analyse movement data and draw inferences about the behaviours that shape it. The statistical robustness and predictive ability of state–space models make them the most promising avenue towards a new type of movement ecology that fuses insights from the study of animal behaviour, biogeography and spatial population dynamics.},

abstract = {A long-standing challenge for population biology has been to understand why some species are characterized by populations that fluctuate in size independently, while populations of other species fluctuate synchronously across space. The effects of climatic variation and dispersal have been invoked to explain synchronous population dynamics, however an understanding of the relative influence of these drivers in natural populations is lacking. Here we compare support for dispersal- versus climate-driven models of interspecific variation in synchrony using 27 years of observations of 65 butterfly species at 10 sites spanning 2750 m of elevation in Northern California. The degree of spatial synchrony exhibited by each butterfly species was used as a response in a unique approach that allowed us to investigate whether interspecific variation in response to climate or dispersal propensity was most predictive of interspecific variation in synchrony. We report that variation in sensitivity to climate explained 50{\%} of interspecific variation in synchrony, whereas variation in dispersal propensity explained 23{\%}. Sensitivity to the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation, a primary driver of regional climate, was the best predictor of synchrony. Combining sensitivity to climate and dispersal propensity into a single model did not greatly increase model performance, confirming the primacy of climatic sensitivity for driving spatial synchrony in butterflies. Finally, we uncovered a relationship between spatial synchrony and population decline that is consistent with theory, but small in magnitude, which suggests that the degree to which populations fluctuate in synchrony is of limited use for understanding the ongoing decline of the Northern California butterfly fauna.},

We highlight how these threats have affected the conservation status and ecological functioning of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores on Earth. Consistent with theory, empirical studies increasingly show that large carnivores have substantial effects on the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Significant cascading trophic interactions, mediated by their prey or sympatric mesopredators, arise when some of these carnivores are extirpated from or repatriated to ecosystems. Unexpected effects of trophic cascades on various taxa and processes include changes to bird, mammal, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness; subsidies to scavengers; altered disease dynamics; carbon sequestration; modified stream morphology; and crop damage. Promoting tolerance and coexistence with large carnivores is a crucial societal challenge that will ultimately determine the fate of Earth's largest carnivores and all that depends upon them, including humans.},

abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.

abstract = {Most ecosystems have multiple predator species that not only compete for shared prey, but also pose direct threats to each other. These intraguild interactions are key drivers of carnivore community structure, with ecosystem-wide cascading effects. Yet, behavioral mechanisms for coexistence of multiple carnivore species remain poorly understood. The challenges of studying large, free-ranging carnivores have resulted in mainly coarse-scale examination of behavioral strategies without information about all interacting competitors. We overcame some of these challenges by examining the concurrent fine-scale movement decisions of almost all individuals of four large mammalian carnivore species in a closed terrestrial system. We found that the intensity ofintraguild interactions did not follow a simple hierarchical allometric pattern, because spatial and behavioral tactics of subordinate species changed with threat and resource levels across seasons. Lions (Panthera leo) were generally unrestricted and anchored themselves in areas rich in not only their principal prey, but also, during periods of resource limitation (dry season), rich in the main prey for other carnivores. Because of this, the greatest cost (potential intraguild predation) for subordinate carnivores was spatially coupled with the highest potential benefit of resource acquisition (prey-rich areas), especially in the dry season. Leopard (P. pardus) and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) overlapped with the home range of lions but minimized their risk using fine-scaled avoidance behaviors and restricted resource acquisition tactics. The cost of intraguild competition was most apparent for cheetahs, especially during the wet season, as areas with energetically rewarding large prey (wildebeest) were avoided when they overlapped highly with the activity areas of lions. Contrary to expectation, the smallest species (African wild dog, Lycaon pictus) did not avoid only lions, but also used multiple tactics to minimize encountering all other competitors. Intraguild competition thus forced wild dogs into areas with the lowest resource availability year round. Coexistence of multiple carnivore species has typically been explained by dietary niche separation, but our multi-scaled movement results suggest that differences in resource acquisition may instead be a consequence of avoiding intraguild competition. We generate a more realistic representation of hierarchical behavioral interactions that may ultimately drive spatially explicit trophic structures of multi-predator communities.},

abstract = {We studied black-tailed deer, Odocoileus hemionus columbianus, in northern California, USA, during winter to test the importance of thermal conditions on habitat selection. During warm days, temperatures from black-body devices were higher than ambient air temperatures in habitats other than live oak, Quercus wislizenii, but were closer to ambient temperatures in dense live-oak cover. Deer were more likely to occur in or near (5 150 m) live oak than were random locations, spending 80{\%} of their time in or near live oak during day and 70{\%} of their time in that habitat at night. We determined whether deer would occur in or near live oak based on the interaction between wind speed and relative humidity, which had an 18{\%} probability of being the best model. We formulated a resource-selection function, which indicated that a point in or near live-oak cover was more likely to be a deer location than a random point (P = 0.004). When it was windy, habitat was not a significant predictor of deer locations versus random points (P {\textgreater} 0.05). When it was calm, not only was habitat a significant predictor (P = 0.035), but the model performed substantially better than did the model for all wind conditions based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) scores. We concluded that black-tailed deer in winter pelage were using live-oak thickets to ameliorate heat gain on calm, warm days with low humidity, but acknowledge that other factors, such as risk of predation, also may play a role. Our results have implications for assessing thermal data in studies of resource selection by other large herbivores.},

The correct statistical approach to assess this degree of agreement is not obvious. Correlation and regression studies are frequently proposed. However, correlation studies the relationship between one variable and another, not the differences, and it is not recommended as a method for assessing the comparability between methods. In 1983 Altman and Bland (B{\&}A) proposed an alternative analysis, based on the quantification of the agreement between two quantitative measurements by studying the mean difference and constructing limits of agreement. The B{\&}A plot analysis is a simple way to evaluate a bias between the mean differences, and to estimate an agreement interval, within which 95{\%} of the differences of the second method, compared to the first one, fall. Data can be analyzed both as unit differences plot and as percentage differences plot. The B{\&}A plot method only defines the intervals of agreements, it does not say whether those limits are acceptable or not. Acceptable limits must be defined a priori, based on clinical necessity, biological considerations or other goals. The aim of this article is to provide guidance on the use and interpretation of Bland Altman analysis in method comparison studies.},

In areas of changing land-use and increasing human–animal conflict, responses of wildlife to direct human interventions can inform managers and planners. During August 2004, the boundary fences between Phinda Private Game Reserve and two neighbouring reserves were removed. This study examined behavioural responses of the resident elephants. Older, recently introduced bulls moved into the new area during the first month after fence removal, while younger resident bulls and family groups took between five and eight months. Initially family groups only moved into the new area at night and spent minimal time there, while older bulls spent longer periods of time, regardless of time of day. One year after fence removal, most of the elephants had only expanded their home ranges slightly into the new area. One of the findings of this study is that elephants appear to act cautiously in exploring new areas and responded by moving into the area slowly and over a relatively long time period. This cautious behaviour reduced through time as animals became more familiar with the area. The spatial scale of response of the elephants was relatively small, while the temporal scale of response was relatively large.},

abstract = {1. Despite the identification of internal state as a fundamental component of animal movement, the effect of an individual's internal physiological state on movement remains poorly understood. African elephants (Loxodonta africana) alter their behaviour in response to their physiological state, and elevated stress hormone concentrations have been associated with reclusive behaviour and aggression towards humans. Thus, a better understanding of the link between internal physiological state and movement is important in advancing the field of movement ecology, and the ecology and management of elephants. 2. We compared the movement paths of African elephants in two physiological states (basal and elevated stress hormone levels) to understand the variation in the use of space in relation to the proximity of environmental features and refugia. 3. We documented differences in the elephants' use of space along movement paths by physiological state. Elephant family groups in a basal physiological state tended to venture away from refugia and commercial tree plantations, and use areas in closer proximity to fresh water. In contrast, elephant family groups in an elevated physiological state tended to use areas near refugia and commercial tree plantations. The use of commercial tree plantations during elevated states highlights an important concern for human safety in the context of human– elephant conflict. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings suggest that fine-scale movement patterns and the use of specific environmental features by elephants are associated with differences in elephant physiological state. Therefore, future attempts to describe or predict typically complex animal movement could be enhanced by incorporating measures of their physiological state. Given that elephants are more prone to habitat disturbance and aggression when in an elevated physiological state, information about elephant movement behaviour could be used in combination with real-time tracking data to predict when and where elephants are potentially in elevated physiological states and limit human access to these areas, which might mitigate human– elephant conflict.},

abstract = {The elephant with its low surface-to-volume ratio presents an interesting problem concerning heat dissipation. To understand how such large mammals remain in thermal balance, we determined the major avenues of heat loss for an adult African elephant and an immature Indian elephant. Because conventional physiological measurements are difficult for these animals, the present study used a non-invasive technique, infrared thermography, to measure skin temperatures of each elephant. Detailed surface temperature profiles and surface area measurements of each elephant were used in standard equations for convective, conductive and radiant heat transfer. Results demonstrated that heat transfer by free convection and radiation accounted for 86{\%} of the total heat loss for the elephants at EA= 12.6 "C. Heat transfer across the ears, an important thermal window at high ambient temperatures, represented less than 8{\%} of the total heat loss. Surface area of the animals, and metabolic heat production calculated from total heat loss of the African elephant, scaled predictably with body mass. In contrast, the thermal conductance of the elephants (71.6 W / T , African; 84.5 W/"C, Indian) was three to five times higher than predicted from an allometric relationship for smaller mammals. The high thermal conductance of elephants is attributed to the absence of fur and appears to counteract reduced heat transfer associated with a low surface-to-volume ratio.},

abstract = {Migration is an important, but threatened ecological process. Conserving migration requires the maintenance of functional connectivity across sufficiently large areas. Therefore, we need to know if, where and why species migrate. Elephants are highly mobile and can travel long distances but we do not know if they migrate. Here, we analysed the movement trajectories of 139 savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) within eight clusters of protected areas across southern Africa to determine if elephants migrate, and if so, where, how and why they migrate. Only 25 of these elephants migrated. Elephants are a facultative partially migratory species, where only some individuals in a population migrate opportunistically, and not every year. Elephants migrated between distinct seasonal ranges corresponding to southern Africa's dry and wet seasons. The timing of wet season migrations was associated with the onset of rainfall and the subsequent greening up of forage. Conversely, the duration, distance, and the timing of dry season migrations varied idiosyncratically. The drivers of elephant migration are likely a complex interaction between individual traits, density, and the distribution and availability of resources. Despite most migrations crossing administrative boundaries, conservation networks provided functional space for elephants to migrate.},

abstract = {To conserve body water, mammals may reduce evaporative water loss by storing heat, allowing core body temperature to rise more than usual during the day, and to fall more than usual during the cooler night, so demonstrating heterothermy. It has been proposed that elephants are heterothermic, but body temperature never has been measured in elephants over 24 h at environmental temperatures higher than body temperature, where elephants would have to rely on evaporative cooling to maintain homeothermy. We used ingested temperature data loggers to record core temperature of four partly free-ranging savanna elephants exposed to high solar radiation and environmental temperatures that exceeded core temperature ({\textgreater} 36 °C) in their natural habitat. The elephants maintained core temperature at an average 36.6 °C within narrow daily limits of about 1.3 °C. While mean 24-h core temperature increased with maximum air temperature, it did not increase with mean air temperature. Maximum and minimum daily core temperatures also did not change with maximum air temperatures. As a result, core temperature range remained constant despite large variations in daily air temperatures. Contrary to the view that elephants exhibit heterothermy to cope with heat, savanna elephants in their natural habitat with access to adequate resources of food and water, and able to use thermoregulatory behaviour, maintained homeothermy.},

abstract = {Animal social networks are descriptions of social structure which, aside from their intrinsic interest for understanding sociality, can have significant bearing across many fields of biology. Network analysis provides a flexible toolbox for testing a broad range of hypotheses, and for describing the social system of species or populations in a quantitative and comparable manner. However, it requires careful consideration of underlying assumptions, in particular differentiating real from observed networks and controlling for inherent biases that are common in social data. We provide a practical guide for using this framework to analyse animal social systems and test hypotheses. First, we discuss key considerations when defining nodes and edges, and when designing methods for collecting data. We discuss different approaches for inferring social networks from these data and displaying them. We then provide an overview of methods for quantifying properties of nodes and networks, as well as for testing hypotheses concerning network structure and network processes. Finally, we provide information about assessing the power and accuracy of an observed network. Alongside this manuscript, we provide appendices containing background information on common programming routines and worked examples of how to perform network analysis using the r programming language. We conclude by discussing some of the major current challenges in social network analysis and interesting future directions. In particular, we highlight the under-exploited potential of experimental manipulations on social networks to address research questions.},

abstract = {Resources are unequally distributed over the landscapes and it is only seldom that food of a herbivore at a given spot exactly matches its requirements. However, because non-sessile animals can move, they can assemble a diet from different patches that, in its total, does meet the intake requirements. Because herbivores of different sizes have different requirements for energy and nutrients, a linearprogramming model that takes into account the different satisficing requirements of herbivores of a range of body masses (or of reproductive status) yields new insights into the causality of the differential way that these animals use the same landscape. Depending on landscape configuration and extent, and especially grain size of the distribution of resources, our model predicts that lactating females are much more constrained than other animals of the same species vis-{\`{a}}-vis the array of patches in the landscape. We also predict that small ruminants should be much rarer than large ruminants, and conclude that small ruminants can only survive under most circumstances if they are specialised feeders or if they live in a fine-grained landscape. We further conclude that natural selection favours ruminants with a large body mass to those with a small body mass if nutrient acquirement is the dominant selection force.},

Interaction dynamics revealed how pumas successfully utilized terrain (e.g., fleeing up steep, wooded hillsides) as well as evasive maneuvers (e.g., jumping into trees, running in figure-8 patterns) to increase their escape distance from the overall faster hounds (avg. 2.3× faster). These adaptive strategies were essential to evasion in light of the mean 1.6× higher mass-specific energetic costs of the chase for pumas compared to hounds (mean: 0.76 $\backslash$textlessitalic$\backslash$textgreatervs.$\backslash$textless/italic$\backslash$textgreater 1.29 kJ kg $\backslash$textlesssup$\backslash$textgreater−1$\backslash$textless/sup$\backslash$textgreater min $\backslash$textlesssup$\backslash$textgreater−1$\backslash$textless/sup$\backslash$textgreater , respectively).

abstract = {Vegetation gradients developing around water sources (i.e. piospheres) are important features of arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Studied extensively in pastoral areas, piospheres have rarely been investigated in areas hosting rich herbivore diversity. We studied piospheres in woody cover assessed through remote-sensing in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, which has one of the world's largest elephant populations. As no preferred statistical model for piosphere studies has emerged, we first contrasted results from ordinary least-square (OLS) regressions on raw data with those from other statistical models (OLS on aggregated data and simultaneous autoregressive models on raw data), and selected the most parsimonious, unbiased, model to study the influence of artificial and natural waterholes, and the abundance of elephants, others browsers, and grazers on piospheres. OLS models provided unbiased parameter estimates, despite the strong spatial autocorrelation present in woody cover data, whereas other statistical models had important drawbacks. Using an OLS framework we showed that despite an important negative non-linear mean effect, distance-to-water was a poor predictor of woody cover at any location. Woody cover was on average more reduced in the vicinity of water at artificial waterholes than at natural waterholes. Elephant abundance was not consistently associated with lower woody cover, and poorly explained woody cover heterogeneity, as did all other herbivore-related variables. Our study indicates that piospheres may develop differently in pastoral and protected areas, suggesting the importance of herbivore diversity in ecosystem functioning. Our results also show that heterogeneity in woody cover persists within piospheres, calling for further investigation on the origin and role of this heterogeneity in the maintenance of ecological processes and biodiversity within these key-areas of the landscape},

abstract = {Mammalian carnivores have suffered the biggest range contraction among all biodiversity and are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. Therefore, we identified priority areas for the conservation of mammalian carnivores, while accounting for species-specific requirements for connectivity and expected agricultural and urban expansion. While prioritizing for carnivores only, we were also able to test their effectiveness as surrogates for 23,110 species of amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles and 867 terrestrial ecoregions. We then assessed the risks to carnivore conservation within each country that makes a contribution to global carnivore conservation. We found that land use change will potentially lead to important range losses, particularly amongst already threatened carnivore species. In addition, the 17{\%} of land targeted for protection under the Aichi Target 11 was found to be inadequate to conserve carnivores under expected land use change. Our results also highlight that land use change will decrease the effectiveness of carnivores to protect other threatened species, especially threatened amphibians. In addition, the risk of human-carnivore conflict is potentially high in countries where we identified spatial priorities for their conservation. As meeting the global biodiversity target will be inadequate for carnivore protection, innovative interventions are needed to conserve carnivores outside protected areas to compliment any proposed expansion of the protected area network.},

abstract = {Heterothermy, a variability in body temperature beyond the limits of homeothermy, has been advanced as a key adaptation of Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) to their arid-zone life. We measured body temperature using implanted data loggers, for a 1-year period, in Wve oryx free-living in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. As predicted for adaptive heterothermy, during hot months compared to cooler months, not only were maximum daily body temper-atures higher (41.1 0.3 vs. 39.7 0.1°C, P = 0.0002) but minimum daily body temperatures also were lower (36.1 0.3 vs. 36.8 0.2°C, P = 0.04), resulting in a larger daily amplitude of the body temperature rhythm (5.0 0.5 vs. 2.9 0.2°C, P = 0.0007), while mean daily body temperature rose by only 0.4°C. The maximum daily amplitude of the body temperature rhythm reached 7.7°C for two of our oryx during the hot-dry period, the largest amplitude ever recorded for a large mammal. Body temper-ature variability was inXuenced not only by ambient tem-perature but also water availability, with oryx displaying larger daily amplitudes of the body temperature rhythm during warm-dry months compared to warm-wet months (3.6 0.6 vs. 2.3 0.3°C, P = 0.005), even though ambi-ent temperatures were the same. Free-living Arabian oryx therefore employ heterothermy greater than that recorded in any other large mammal, but water limitation, rather than high ambient temperature, seems to be the primary driver of this heterothermy.},

abstract = {In African savannas, surface water can become limiting and an understanding of how animals address the trade-offs between different constraints to access this resource is nee- ded. Here, wedescribe water access by ten African herbivore species in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, and we explore four possible determinants of the observed behav- iours: water abundance, thermoregulation, perceived pre- dation risk and interference competition. On average, herbivores were observed to drink in 80{\%} of visits to a waterhole. The probability of drinking was higher in 2003 (474 mm)than in2004(770 mm),andat the end of the dry season than at its beginning. For larger species, this proba- bility may also be related to risks of interference competition with elephants or other herbivores. For smaller species, this probability may also be related to the perceived risk of pre- dation.Wealso investigate the time spent accessing water to drink. The influence of herd size and the presence of young on the time spent accessing water for most species suggests that perceived predation risk plays a role. Thermoregulation also affects this time: during the hottest periods, herbivores spend less time in open areas, unless when wind is strong, probably owing to evapotranspired heat loss.},

abstract = {Water provisioning is a controversial yet common practice and its consequences for wildlife and vegetation have fuelled well-worn debates. Contradictory opinions exist on the effect of water provisioning on elephant abundance and distribution. Here, we evaluated how water utilisation patterns, water source type, and availability affect the spatial utilisation patterns of elephants in Kruger National Park. We segmented the seasonal movement paths of 26 elephant breeding herds into trips, defined as segments of the trajectory that occur between two consecutive visits to water sources. We classified the trips as natural or artificial depending on the start and end water source. Elephants visited rivers more often than artificial waterholes. The probability of visiting water was highest during the hot afternoon and most trips lasted less than 36 h. Artificial waterholes made trips further from rivers potentially less costly, and for a third of the total area traversed by elephants, they visited waterholes instead of rivers. Additionally, artificial waterholes may increase the intensity of use in some areas. Water provisioning in Kruger alters elephant spatial utilisation patterns. Removing artificial waterholes in Kruger might reduce the area traversed and educe spatio-temporal variability in how elephants utilise space, a desirable outcome for conservation management.},

abstract = {Empirical field data describing daily and seasonal cycles in body temperature (Tb) of free-ranging Crocodylus porosus (32-1010 kg) can be predicted by a mathematical analysis. The analysis provides a mechanistic explanation for the decreased amplitude of daily cycles in Tb and the increase in 'average' Tb with increasing mass. Assessments of 'average' daily Tb were made by dividing the integral of the difference between measured values of Tb and minimum operative temperature by the period of integration, to yield a thermal index expressing relative 'warmth' of crocodiles. The average daily Tb of a 1010 kg crocodile was 3.7 degreesC warmer than that of a 42 kg individual in summer and 1.9 degreesC warmer than that of a 32 kg individual in winter. The success of this mathematical approach confirms that crocodiles are simple ectotherms and that there is unlikely to be a significant contribution to their thermal biology from physiological mechanisms. Behaviour, however, is very important even in large individuals. Crocodiles in the field typically move daily between land and water in cycles that vary seasonally. We predicted Tb for the reverse of these behavioural cycles, which more than doubled seasonal fluctuations in Tb compared with the observed fluctuations. We were also able to predict the Tb of very large, dinosaur-sized crocodiles in a similar climate to that at our study site. A 10 000 kg 'crocodile', for example, would be expected to have a Tb of 31 degreesC in winter, varying by less than 0.1 degreesC during a day when operative temperatures varied by nearly 20 degreesC, from 20 to 38 degreesC. The study confirms that, in low latitudes at least, large dinosaurs must have had an essentially high and stable value of Tb, without any need for endothermy. Also, access to shade or water must have been crucial for the survival of large dinosaurs at low latitudes. Furthermore, the finding of increasing 'average' Tb as ectotherms grow larger may have implications for the metabolic rates of very large reptiles, because the Q10 effect could counteract the downscaling of metabolic rate with mass, an effect that seems not to have been recognised previously.},

abstract = {Managers of reintroduced wildlife commonly encounter behavioral problems post-release that have been linked to physiological condition and elevated stress hormone concentrations. However, there is uncertainty about the generality of a stress response among populations, factors influencing the intensity of the response and the amount of time needed to physiologically acclimatize. We evalu- ated the relationship of temporal, climatic and social factors to stress hormone concentrations in five African elephant (Loxodonta africana) populations follow- ing reintroduction. We determined fecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations (FGMs) in 1567 fecal samples collected from elephants reintroduced to five fenced reserves with differing reintroduction histories in South Africa during 2000–2006. Variation in FGMs across the five reserves was best explained by the number of years that elapsed since initial release. Compared with FGMs 1 year after release, FGMs were 10{\%} lower 10 years after release and 40{\%} lower 24 years after release. Across all reserves, FGMs were consistently highest in the dry season, although daily and monthly temperature and rainfall were not as important as other factors. FGMs did not vary solely in relationship to reserve size or elephant density. Our findings suggest that regardless of reintroduction site conditions, elephants and likely other species subject to reintroduction require an extended period of time to physiologically acclimatize to their new surroundings. Managers should prepare for prolonged behavioral and physiological consequences of long-term elevated stress responses following reintroduction, such as restricted space use and aggres- sive behavior.},

abstract = {Scarcity of resources may result in high levels of animal aggregation; interference competition can occur in such a scenario and play a role in resource acquisition. Here, we test the hypothesis that animals could minimize interference competition by shifting their temporal niches in relation to competitors. In Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we monitored waterholes in order to study agonistic interactions between elephants and other herbivore species. We also used a long-term data set from a yearly survey of waterhole attendance by herbivores to evaluate the influence of the presence of elephants on the use of waterholes by other herbivore species. Our results show that in drier years, waterholes are crowded with elephants early in the afternoon. In general, the species most affected by interference competition with elephants shift their temporal niches at the waterholes, thus maintaining a constant temporal overlaps with elephants. The species less affected by interference competition with elephants show no temporal niche shifts and increase their temporal overlap with elephants at waterholes, as predicted from a noncompetition hypothesis. This study provides evidence that interference competition with a behaviorally dominant large species influences the temporal niches of smaller species, and suggests that the potential costs associated with interference between elephants and other herbivores at waterholes are linked to shifts in diurnal activities rather than interactions and water acquisition itself.},

abstract = {Body mass is the primary determinant of an animal's energy requirements. At their optimum walking speed, large animals have lower mass-specific energy requirements for locomotion than small ones. In animals ranging in size from 0.8 g (roach) to 260 kg (zebu steer), the minimum cost of transport (COT(min)) decreases with increasing body size roughly as COT(min)∝body mass (M(b))(-0.316±0.023) (95{\%} CI). Typically, the variation of COT(min) with body mass is weaker at the intraspecific level as a result of physiological and geometric similarity within closely related species. The interspecific relationship estimates that an adult elephant, with twice the body mass of a mid-sized elephant, should be able to move its body approximately 23{\%} cheaper than the smaller elephant. We sought to determine whether adult Asian and sub-adult African elephants follow a single quasi-intraspecific relationship, and extend the interspecific relationship between COT(min) and body mass to 12-fold larger animals. Physiological and possibly geometric similarity between adult Asian elephants and sub-adult African elephants caused body mass to have a no effect on COT(min) (COT(min)∝M(b)(0.007±0.455)). The COT(min) in elephants occurred at walking speeds between 1.3 and ∼1.5 m s(-1), and at Froude numbers between 0.10 and 0.24. The addition of adult Asian elephants to the interspecific relationship resulted in COT(min)∝M (-0.277±0.046)(b). The quasi-intraspecific relationship between body mass and COT(min) among elephants caused the interspecific relationship to underestimate COT(min) in larger elephants.},

We highlight how these threats have affected the conservation status and ecological functioning of the 31 largest mammalian carnivores on Earth. Consistent with theory, empirical studies increasingly show that large carnivores have substantial effects on the structure and function of diverse ecosystems. Significant cascading trophic interactions, mediated by their prey or sympatric mesopredators, arise when some of these carnivores are extirpated from or repatriated to ecosystems. Unexpected effects of trophic cascades on various taxa and processes include changes to bird, mammal, invertebrate, and herpetofauna abundance or richness; subsidies to scavengers; altered disease dynamics; carbon sequestration; modified stream morphology; and crop damage. Promoting tolerance and coexistence with large carnivores is a crucial societal challenge that will ultimately determine the fate of Earth's largest carnivores and all that depends upon them, including humans.},

abstract = {The loss of apex consumers (large mammals at the top of their food chain) is a major driver of global change [1]. Yet, research on the two main apex consumer guilds, large carnivores [2] and megaherbivores [3], has developed independently, overlooking any potential interactions. Large carnivores provoke behavioral responses in prey [1, 4], driving prey to distribute themselves within a “landscape of fear” [5] and intensify their impacts on lower trophic levels in low-risk areas [6], where they may concentrate nutrients through localized dung deposition [7, 8]. We suggest, however, that megaherbivores modify carnivore-induced trophic cascades. Megaherbivores ($\backslash$textgreater1,000 kg [9]) are largely invulnerable to predation and should respond less to the landscape of fear, thereby counteracting the effects of fear-triggered trophic cascades. By experimentally clearing plots to increase visibility and reduce predation risk, we tested the collective role of both apex consumer guilds in influencing nutrient dynamics in African savanna. We evaluated whether megaherbivores could counteract a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade by redistributing nutrients that accumulate through fear-driven prey aggregations. Our experiment showed that mesoherbivores concentrated fecal nutrients in more open habitat, but that megaherbivores moved nutrients against this fear-driven nutrient accumulation by feeding within the open habitat, yet defecating more evenly across the risk gradient. This work adds to the growing recognition of functional losses that are likely to have accompanied megafaunal extinctions by contributing empirical evidence from one of the last systems with a functionally complete megaherbivore assemblage. Our results suggest that carnivore-induced trophic cascades work differently in a world of giants.},

abstract = {Animals frequently exhibit consistent among-individual differences in behavioural and physiological traits that are inherently flexible. Why should individuals differ consistently in their expression of labile traits? Recently, positive feedbacks between state and behaviour have been proposed as a possible explanation for the maintenance of consistent among-individual differences in both state and behaviour. If state affects behaviour, and behaviour reciprocally affects state, then differences in either state or behaviour that arise among individuals even by chance could be maintained over extended periods of time. We tested for positive feedbacks experimentally using wild-caught red knots (Calidris canutus islandica). In the wild, knots exhibit consistent among-individual differences in digestive physiology (the mass of the muscular part of the stomach, the gizzard) and foraging behaviour (diet), two inherently labile traits. Experimentally manipulated diet quality had a large effect on gizzard mass. Experimentally manipulated gizzard mass reciprocally influenced total food eaten during ad libitum trials. The effect of gizzard mass on diet choice, though in the predicted direction, was not statistically significant. Individuals exhibited consistent differences in foraging behaviour of unknown origin independent of current gizzard mass, as well as large residual unexplained variance in foraging behaviour. These two sources of variation in foraging behaviour overruled the gizzard mass-dependent foraging behaviour and hence eroded the treatment-related differences in gizzard mass. We conclude that positive feedbacks between diet choice and gizzard mass play at best a limited role in maintaining among-individual variation in gizzard mass in red knots. Furthermore, we suggest that many models of state–behaviour feedbacks likely overestimate their potential importance in maintaining long-term among-individual variation in labile traits because most models of state–behaviour feedbacks fail to account for the effects of additional factors that may act to disrupt the feedback loops. The among-individual differences in diet choice observed during solitary foraging trials eroded the consistent among-individual differences in gizzard mass observed following periods of staple diet treatments in which knots foraged in social groups. Social foraging interactions may play an important role determining the expression of foraging behaviours such as intake rate that in turn influence gizzard mass. Further studies are needed to experimentally test the role of social interactions as a mechanism generating consistent among-individual differences in foraging behaviours and gizzard mass. A lay summary is available for this article.},

abstract = {Physical barriers, such as rivers and roads, constrain the movement of animals, usually by preventing access to adjacent habitats and impeding dispersal. Fences are artificial barriers that are commonly used as a conservation tool to intentionally restrict movements of animals to within protected reserves. However, the potential edge-effect of fences on the behaviour of animals within reserves is poorly understood. We examined the effect of fences on the movement patterns of African elephant (Loxodonta africana), an ecosystem modifier, in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. We used linear and non-linear models to determine the relationship between minimum distance from fence and seasonal daily net displacement of six GPS-collared female elephant. Elephant movement patterns were best explained by a piecewise regression that showed a strong negative relationship between minimum distance from fence and daily net displacement up to a " breakpoint" distance of 2551. m in the dry season and 3829. m in the wet season. The effect of the fence dissipated beyond this distance in both seasons. The increased tortuosity in movement patterns of elephant in the central area of the reserve suggested that they used this area more intensively for foraging compared to the peripheral area, as confirmed by differences in habitat selection. This occurs despite there being no difference in habitat composition between these areas. The decreased use of areas near the fence and more intensive foraging in the central areas constitute an important edge-effect of fences. Since elephant are ecosystem engineers, such edge-effects could potentially cascade throughout the reserve, adversely altering ecologically processes, particularly in reserves with a high edge-to-area ratio. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Movement of individual organisms is fundamental to life, quilting our planet in a rich tapestry of phenomena with diverse implications for ecosystems and humans. Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality paradigms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at providing a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.

abstract = {In African savannas, surface water can become limiting and an understanding of how animals address the trade-offs between different constraints to access this resource is nee- ded. Here, wedescribe water access by ten African herbivore species in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, and we explore four possible determinants of the observed behav- iours: water abundance, thermoregulation, perceived pre- dation risk and interference competition. On average, herbivores were observed to drink in 80{\%} of visits to a waterhole. The probability of drinking was higher in 2003 (474 mm)than in2004(770 mm),andat the end of the dry season than at its beginning. For larger species, this proba- bility may also be related to risks of interference competition with elephants or other herbivores. For smaller species, this probability may also be related to the perceived risk of pre- dation.Wealso investigate the time spent accessing water to drink. The influence of herd size and the presence of young on the time spent accessing water for most species suggests that perceived predation risk plays a role. Thermoregulation also affects this time: during the hottest periods, herbivores spend less time in open areas, unless when wind is strong, probably owing to evapotranspired heat loss.},

abstract = {Studies aimed at explaining the evolution of phenotypic traits have often solely focused on fitness considerations, ignoring underlying mechanisms. In recent years, there has been an increasing call for integrating mechanistic perspectives in evolutionary considerations, but it is not clear whether and how mechanisms affect the course and outcome of evolution. To study this, we compare four mechanistic implementations of two well-studied models for the evolution of cooperation, the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma ({\{}IPD{\}}) game and the Iterated Snowdrift ({\{}ISD{\}}) game. Behavioural strategies are either implemented by a 1 : 1 genotype–phenotype mapping or by a simple neural network. Moreover, we consider two different scenarios for the effect of mutations. The same set of strategies is feasible in all four implementations, but the probability that a given strategy arises owing to mutation is largely dependent on the behavioural and genetic architecture. Our individual-based simulations show that this has major implications for the evolutionary outcome. In the {\{}ISD{\}}, different evolutionarily stable strategies are predominant in the four implementations, while in the {\{}IPD{\}} each implementation creates a characteristic dynamical pattern. As a consequence, the evolved average level of cooperation is also strongly dependent on the underlying mechanism. We argue that our findings are of general relevance for the evolution of social behaviour, pleading for the integration of a mechanistic perspective in models of social evolution.},

Replicated experimental treatments (400 m2) in a single forest patch were used to exclude elephant, or both elephant and nyala. In each treatment, all woody individuals were identified to species and number of stems, diameter and height were recorded. Results of changes after two years are presented. Individual tree and stem densities had increased in absence of nyala and elephant. Seedling recruitment (based on height and diameter) was inhibited by nyala, and by elephant and nyala in combination, thereby preventing recruitment into the sapling stage. Neither nyala or elephant significantly reduced sapling densities. Excluding both elephant and nyala in combination enhanced recruitment of woody species, as seedling densities increased, indicating that forest regeneration is impacted by both mega- and mesoherbivores. The Sand Forest tree community approached an inverse J-shaped curve, with the highest abundance in the smaller size classes. However, the larger characteristic tree species in particular, such as Newtonia hildebrandtii, were missing cohorts in the middle size classes. When setting management goals to conserve habitats of key importance, conservation management plans need to consider the total herbivore assemblage present and the resulting browsing effects on vegetation. Especially in Africa, where the broadest suite of megaherbivores still persists, and which is currently dealing with the ‘elephant problem', the individual effects of different herbivore species on recruitment and dynamics of forests and woodlands are important issues which need conclusive answers.},

abstract = {A central question in the study of predator-prey relationships is to what extent prey behaviour is determined by avoidance of predators. Here, we test whether the long-term risk of encountering lions and the presence of lions in the vicinity influence the behaviour of large African herbivores at waterholes through avoidance of high-risk areas, increases in group size, changes in temporal niche or changes in the time spent in waterhole areas. In Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, we monitored waterholes to study the behaviour of nine herbivore species under different risks of encountering lions. We radio-collared 26 lions in the study area which provided the opportunity to monitor whether lions were present during observation sessions and to map longer-term seasonal landscapes of risk of encountering lions. Our results show that the preferred prey species for lions (buffalo, kudu and giraffe) avoided risky waterholes. Group size increased as encounter risk increased for only two species (wildebeest and zebra), but this effect was not strong. Interestingly, buffalo avoided the hours of the day which are dangerous when the long-term and short-term risks of encountering lions were high, and all species showed avoidance of waterhole use at night times when lions were in the vicinity. This illustrates well how prey can make temporal adjustments to avoid dangerous periods coinciding with predator hunting. Additionally, many herbivores spent more time accessing water to drink when the long- and short-term risks of encountering lions were high, and they showed longer potential drinking time when the long-term risk of encountering lions was high, suggesting higher levels of vigilance. This study illustrates the diversity of behavioural adjustments to the risk of encountering a predator and how prey respond differently to temporal variations in this risk. ¬{\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2009.},

abstract = {Mammalian carnivores have suffered the biggest range contraction among all biodiversity and are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation. Therefore, we identified priority areas for the conservation of mammalian carnivores, while accounting for species-specific requirements for connectivity and expected agricultural and urban expansion. While prioritizing for carnivores only, we were also able to test their effectiveness as surrogates for 23,110 species of amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles and 867 terrestrial ecoregions. We then assessed the risks to carnivore conservation within each country that makes a contribution to global carnivore conservation. We found that land use change will potentially lead to important range losses, particularly amongst already threatened carnivore species. In addition, the 17{\%} of land targeted for protection under the Aichi Target 11 was found to be inadequate to conserve carnivores under expected land use change. Our results also highlight that land use change will decrease the effectiveness of carnivores to protect other threatened species, especially threatened amphibians. In addition, the risk of human-carnivore conflict is potentially high in countries where we identified spatial priorities for their conservation. As meeting the global biodiversity target will be inadequate for carnivore protection, innovative interventions are needed to conserve carnivores outside protected areas to compliment any proposed expansion of the protected area network.},

abstract = {Within a landscape where prey has an aggregated distribution, predators can take advantage of the spatial autocorrelation of prey density and intensify their search effort in areas of high prey density by using area-restricted search behaviour. In African arid and semi-arid savannas, large herbivores tend to aggregate around scarce water sources. We tested the hypothesis that water sources are a key determinant of habitat selection and movement patterns of large free-ranging predators in such savannas, using the example of the African lion. We used data from 19 GPS radio-collared lions in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Maps of lions' trajectories showed that waterholes are key loci on the lions' route-maps. Compositional analyses revealed that lions significantly selected for areas located within 2 km of a waterhole. In addition, analysis of lions' night paths showed that when lions are close to a waterhole ($\backslash$textless 2 km), they move at lower speed, cover shorter distances per night (both path length and net displacement) and follow a more tortuous path (higher turning angle, lower straightness index and higher fractal dimension) than when they are further from a waterhole. Hence, our results strongly suggest that lions adopt area-restricted searching in the vicinity of waterholes, and reduce their search effort to minimize the time spent far from a waterhole. They provide an illustration of how key habitat features that determine the dispersion of prey (e.g. waterholes in this study) have an influence on the spatial ecology and movement patterns of terrestrial predators.},

abstract = {To improve the efficacy of protected areas in conserving ecological processes, initiatives such as the megaparks for metapopulations strive to increase connectivity between small and often isolated protected areas. Increasing connectivity between protected areas may mediate the apparent impact of elephants on vegetation and promote regional population stability through the spatial structuring of their populations. This relies on asynchronous population dynamics between interconnected subpopulations separated by distance. It is likely that the spatial responses of elephants to environmental variation drive this asynchrony. Therefore, developing a thorough knowledge of the spatial responses of elephants to their environment can inform management decisions to conserve suitable habitat, and promote population persistence through the maintenance of ecological processes. Most of what we know about the spatial responses of elephants is from studies that focused on explaining their spatial distribution or re-distribution in space, and studies that aimed to identify factors that determine resources use and selection. Recently, technological and analytical advances have marked a shift to studies that aim to assess the behavioural responses of animals to their environment by considering how individuals change their movement. Therefore, my approach in this thesis was to evaluate the environmental determinants determinants of the movement patterns of elephants in the Kruger National Park. To do this, I used hourly location time series datasets acquired from 26-collared elephant cows distributed across Kruger. In chapter 3, I modelled the movement behaviour of the elephants using dynamic Brownian bridge movement modelling. I then evaluated how well different environmental factors explain changes in their movement behaviour using a mixed modelling approach at multiple temporal scales. Distance from water, primary productivity, vegetation structure, and temperature could explain changes in the movement behaviour of the elephants. The factors that could best explain changes in their movement behaviour varied between seasons and among temporal scales. Therefore, elephants adjusted their movement scale-dependently in response to their environment. Management interventions could induce artificial patterns of elephant movement, potentially uncoupling them from the processes that result in asynchrony in the dynamics of local populations. Therefore, the influence and consequences of management interventions such as the provisioning of water remain controversial. In chapter 4, I examined how the provisioning of water influences the movement patterns and the resulting spatial distribution of elephants. When elephants used artificial waterholes, they used areas more than double the distance away from natural water sources in comparison to when they used natural water sources. This increased the total area used by elephants by more than one third. The resulting change in the distribution of elephants may accentuate their impact on vegetation and have demographic consequences. Elephants respond to the distribution and availability of resources, and rather than returning to the artificial manipulation of numbers to relieve symptoms, I argue that management should continue to base their decisions on ecological principals. Many questions remain, and my hopes are that this research contributes to what we know about elephants and how best to manage them, or rather, how best to manage their responses to our interferences.},

abstract = {Elephant movement patterns in relation to surface water demonstrate that they are a water-dependent species. Thus, there has been interest in using surface water management to mitigate problems associated with localized elephant overabundance. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying the elephant's water dependence remain unclear. Although thermoregulation is likely an important driver, the relationship between thermoregulation, water use and climate has not been quantified. We measured skin surface temperature of and cutaneous water loss from 13 elephants (seven African, 3768±642 kg; six Asian, 3834±498 kg) and determined the contribution of evaporative cooling to their thermal and water budgets across a range of air temperatures (8-33°C). We also measured respiratory evaporative water loss and resting metabolic heat production on a subset of elephants (N=7). The rate of cutaneous evaporative water loss ranged between 0.31 and 8.9 g min(-1) m(-2) for Asian elephants and 0.26 and 6.5 g min(-1) m(-2) for African elephants. Simulated thermal and water budgets using climate data from Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and Okaukuejo, Namibia, suggested that the 24-h evaporative cooling water debt incurred in warm climates can be more than 4.5 times that incurred in mesic climates. This study confirms elephants are obligate evaporative coolers but suggests that classification of elephants as water dependent is insufficient given the importance of climate in determining the magnitude of this dependence. These data highlight the potential for a physiological modeling approach to predicting the utility of surface water management for specific populations.},

abstract = {The loss of apex consumers (large mammals at the top of their food chain) is a major driver of global change [1]. Yet, research on the two main apex consumer guilds, large carnivores [2] and megaherbivores [3], has developed independently, overlooking any potential interactions. Large carnivores provoke behavioral responses in prey [1, 4], driving prey to distribute themselves within a “landscape of fear” [5] and intensify their impacts on lower trophic levels in low-risk areas [6], where they may concentrate nutrients through localized dung deposition [7, 8]. We suggest, however, that megaherbivores modify carnivore-induced trophic cascades. Megaherbivores ($\backslash$textgreater1,000 kg [9]) are largely invulnerable to predation and should respond less to the landscape of fear, thereby counteracting the effects of fear-triggered trophic cascades. By experimentally clearing plots to increase visibility and reduce predation risk, we tested the collective role of both apex consumer guilds in influencing nutrient dynamics in African savanna. We evaluated whether megaherbivores could counteract a behaviorally mediated trophic cascade by redistributing nutrients that accumulate through fear-driven prey aggregations. Our experiment showed that mesoherbivores concentrated fecal nutrients in more open habitat, but that megaherbivores moved nutrients against this fear-driven nutrient accumulation by feeding within the open habitat, yet defecating more evenly across the risk gradient. This work adds to the growing recognition of functional losses that are likely to have accompanied megafaunal extinctions by contributing empirical evidence from one of the last systems with a functionally complete megaherbivore assemblage. Our results suggest that carnivore-induced trophic cascades work differently in a world of giants. le Roux et al. experimentally show how megaherbivores can modify predator-triggered trophic cascades. Where aggregations of fearful prey can lead to fecal nutrient accumulation, megaherbivores redistribute these nutrients away from such predator-maintained biogeochemical hotspots by feeding in areas frequented by prey species but defecating widely.},

Here we report evidence for the importance of the abiotic terrain feature `gradient' in guiding the movements of African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana). Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking data overlaid onto digital elevation and surface gradient models show that elephants tend to avoid steep slopes. Energy calculations suggest that even minor hills are considerable energy barriers for heavy animals. Elephants are keystone animals in Africa and Asia 1, and effective conservation planning strategies must integrate a thorough knowledge of the range use and spatial requirements of these magnificent animals. Only with such knowledge can we ensure that elephants will be able to survive despite increasingly aggressive human encroachment into their traditional territory 2. Moreover, there is much to be learned scientifically from understanding the ecological requirements - as well as limitations - of the last remaining representatives of a once cosmopolitan and ecologically critical megafauna. Early studies of elephant movements deployed radio tracking from the air and provided rather infrequent `fixes' which painted an incomplete picture of spatial utilisation 3. Modern GPS collars using a satellite and/or cell-phone link allow us to collect movement data with high temporal and spatial resolution 4, reflecting true range use by also mapping areas not visited.

Researchers have long attempted to follow animals as they move through their environment. Until relatively recently, however, such efforts were limited to short distances and times in species large enough to carry large batteries and transmitters. New technologies have opened up new frontiers in animal tracking remote data collection. Hussey et al. review the unique directions such efforts have taken for marine systems, while Kays et al. review recent advances for terrestrial species. We have entered a new era of animal ecology, where animals act as both subjects and samplers of their environments.

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDThe movement of animals makes them fascinating but difficult study subjects. Animal movements underpin many biological phenomena, and understanding them is critical for applications in conservation, health, and food. Traditional approaches to animal tracking used field biologists wielding antennas to record a few dozen locations per animal, revealing only the most general patterns of animal space use. The advent of satellite tracking automated this process, but initially was limited to larger animals and increased the resolution of trajectories to only a few hundred locations per animal. The last few years have shown exponential improvement in tracking technology, leading to smaller tracking devices that can return millions of movement steps for ever-smaller animals. Finally, we have a tool that returns high-resolution data that reveal the detailed facets of animal movement and its many implications for biodiversity, animal ecology, behavior, and ecosystem function.
ADVANCESImproved technology has brought animal tracking into the realm of big data, not only through high-resolution movement trajectories, but also through the addition of other on-animal sensors and the integration of remote sensing data about the environment through which these animals are moving. These new data are opening up a breadth of new scientific questions about ecology, evolution, and physiology and enable the use of animals as sensors of the environment. High–temporal resolution movement data also can document brief but important contacts between animals, creating new opportunities to study social networks, as well as interspecific interactions such as competition and predation. With solar panels keeping batteries charged, “lifetime” tracks can now be collected for some species, while broader approaches are aiming for species-wide sampling across multiple populations. Miniaturized tags also help reduce the impact of the devices on the study subjects, improving animal welfare and scientific results. As in other disciplines, the explosion of data volume and variety has created new challenges and opportunities for information management, integration, and analysis. In an exciting interdisciplinary push, biologists, statisticians, and computer scientists have begun to develop new tools that are already leading to new insights and scientific breakthroughs.
OUTLOOKWe suggest that a golden age of animal tracking science has begun and that the upcoming years will be a time of unprecedented exciting discoveries. Technology continues to improve our ability to track animals, with the promise of smaller tags collecting more data, less invasively, on a greater variety of animals. The big-data tracking studies that are just now being pioneered will become commonplace. If analytical developments can keep pace, the field will be able to develop real-time predictive models that integrate habitat preferences, movement abilities, sensory capacities, and animal memories into movement forecasts. The unique perspective offered by big-data animal tracking enables a new view of animals as naturally evolved sensors of environment, which we think has the potential to help us monitor the planet in completely new ways. A massive multi-individual monitoring program would allow a quorum sensing of our planet, using a variety of species to tap into the diversity of senses that have evolved across animal groups, providing new insight on our world through the sixth sense of the global animal collective. We expect that the field will soon reach a transformational point where these studies do more than inform us about particular species of animals, but allow the animals to teach us about the world. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/348/6240/aaa2478/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Big-data animal tracking.The red trajectory shows how studies can now track animals with unprecedented detail, allowing researchers to predict the causes and consequences of movements, and animals to become environmental sensors. Multisensor tracking tags monitor movement, behavior, physiology, and environmental context. Geo- and biosciences merge now using a multitude of remote-sensing data. Understanding how social and interspecific interactions affect movement is the next big frontier.
Moving animals connect our world, spreading pollen, seeds, nutrients, and parasites as they go about the their daily lives. Recent integration of high-resolution Global Positioning System and other sensors into miniaturized tracking tags has dramatically improved our ability to describe animal movement. This has created opportunities and challenges that parallel big data transformations in other fields and has rapidly advanced animal ecology and physiology. New analytical approaches, combined with remotely sensed or modeled environmental information, have opened up a host of new questions on the causes of movement and its consequences for individuals, populations, and ecosystems. Simultaneous tracking of multiple animals is leading to new insights on species interactions and, scaled up, may enable distributed monitoring of both animals and our changing environment.},

abstract = {Movement of organisms is one of the key mechanisms shaping biodiversity, e.g. the distribution of genes, individuals and species in space and time. Recent technological and conceptual advances have improved our ability to assess the causes and consequences of individual movement, and led to the emergence of the new field of ‘movement ecology'. Here, we outline how movement ecology can contribute to the broad field of biodiversity research, i.e. the study of processes and patterns of life among and across different scales, from genes to ecosystems, and we propose a conceptual framework linking these hitherto largely separated fields of research. Our framework builds on the concept of movement ecology for individuals, and demonstrates its importance for linking individual organismal movement with biodiversity. First, organismal movements can provide ‘mobile links' between habitats or ecosystems, thereby connecting resources, genes, and processes among otherwise separate locations. Understanding these mobile links and their impact on biodiversity will be facilitated by movement ecology, because mobile links can be created by different modes of movement (i.e., foraging, dispersal, migration) that relate to different spatiotemporal scales and have differential effects on biodiversity. Second, organismal movements can also mediate coexistence in communities, through ‘equalizing' and ‘stabilizing' mechanisms. This novel integrated framework provides a conceptual starting point for a better understanding of biodiversity dynamics in light of individual movement and space-use behavior across spatiotemporal scales. By illustrating this framework with examples, we argue that the integration of movement ecology and biodiversity research will also enhance our ability to conserve diversity at the genetic, species, and ecosystem levels.},

abstract = {Physiological stress responses allow individuals to adapt to changes in their status or surroundings, but chronic exposure to stressors could have detrimental effects. Increased stress hormone secretion leads to short-term escape behavior; however, no studies have assessed the potential of longer-term escape behavior, when individuals are in a chronic physiological state. Such refuge behavior is likely to take two forms, where an individual or population restricts its space use patterns spatially (spatial refuge hypothesis), or alters its use of space temporally (temporal refuge hypothesis). We tested the spatial and temporal refuge hypotheses by comparing space use patterns among three African elephant populations maintaining different fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations. In support of the spatial refuge hypothesis, the elephant population that maintained elevated FGM concentrations (iSimangaliso) used 20{\%} less of its reserve than did an elephant population with lower FGM concentrations (Pilanesberg) in a reserve of similar size, and 43{\%} less than elephants in the smaller Phinda reserve. We found mixed support for the temporal refuge hypothesis; home range sizes in the iSimangaliso population did not differ by day compared to nighttime, but elephants used areas within their home ranges differently between day and night. Elephants in all three reserves generally selected forest and woodland habitats over grasslands, but elephants in iSimangaliso selected exotic forest plantations over native habitat types. Our findings suggest that chronic stress is associated with restricted space use and altered habitat preferences that resemble a facultative refuge behavioral response. Elephants can maintain elevated FGM levels for ≥ 6 years following translocation, during which they exhibit refuge behavior that is likely a result of human disturbance and habitat conditions. Wildlife managers planning to translocate animals, or to initiate other management activities that could result in chronic stress responses, should consider the potential for, and consequences of, refuge behavior.},

abstract = {Most large terrestrial mammals, including the charismatic species so important for ecotourism, do not have the luxury of rapid micro-evolution or sufficient range shifts as strategies for adjusting to climate change. The rate of climate change is too fast for genetic adaptation to occur in mammals with longevities of decades, typical of large mammals, and landscape fragmentation and population by humans too widespread to allow spontaneous range shifts of large mammals, leaving only the expression of latent phenotypic plasticity to counter effects of climate change. The expression of phenotypic plasticity includes anatomical variation within the same species, changes in phenology, and employment of intrinsic physiological and behavioral capacity that can buffer an animal against the effects of climate change. Whether that buffer will be realized is unknown, because little is known about the efficacy of the expression of plasticity, particularly for large mammals. Future research in climate change biology requires measurement of physiological characteristics of many identified free-living individual animals for long periods, probably decades, to allow us to detect whether expression of phenotypic plasticity will be sufficient to cope with climate change.},

abstract = {Vegetation gradients developing around water sources (i.e. piospheres) are important features of arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Studied extensively in pastoral areas, piospheres have rarely been investigated in areas hosting rich herbivore diversity. We studied piospheres in woody cover assessed through remote-sensing in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, which has one of the world's largest elephant populations. As no preferred statistical model for piosphere studies has emerged, we first contrasted results from ordinary least-square (OLS) regressions on raw data with those from other statistical models (OLS on aggregated data and simultaneous autoregressive models on raw data), and selected the most parsimonious, unbiased, model to study the influence of artificial and natural waterholes, and the abundance of elephants, others browsers, and grazers on piospheres. OLS models provided unbiased parameter estimates, despite the strong spatial autocorrelation present in woody cover data, whereas other statistical models had important drawbacks. Using an OLS framework we showed that despite an important negative non-linear mean effect, distance-to-water was a poor predictor of woody cover at any location. Woody cover was on average more reduced in the vicinity of water at artificial waterholes than at natural waterholes. Elephant abundance was not consistently associated with lower woody cover, and poorly explained woody cover heterogeneity, as did all other herbivore-related variables. Our study indicates that piospheres may develop differently in pastoral and protected areas, suggesting the importance of herbivore diversity in ecosystem functioning. Our results also show that heterogeneity in woody cover persists within piospheres, calling for further investigation on the origin and role of this heterogeneity in the maintenance of ecological processes and biodiversity within these key-areas of the landscape},

abstract = {The performance of populations is affected by environmental change and the resulting evolutionary dynamics. The spatial configuration and size of patches is known to directly influence metapopulation dynamics (spatial forcing). These metapopulation dynamics are also affecting and affected by life history evolution. Given the relevance of metapopulation persistence for biological conservation, and the potential rescuing role of evolution, a firm understanding of the relevance of these eco-evolutionary processes is essential. We here follow a systems modelling approach to disentangle the role of metapopulation structure relative to evolution for metapopulation performance. We developed an individual based systems model that is strongly based and parameterized by results from experimental metapopulations with spider mites. This model enables us to perform virtual translocation and invasion experiments that would have been impossible to conduct in our experimental systems. We show that (1) metapopulation demography is more affected by spatial forcing than by observed life history evolution, but that life history evolution contributes up to 20 percent of the variation in demographic measures related to spatiotemporal variance in population sizes, (2) metapopulation performance is not enhanced by evolution, and (3) evolution is optimising individual performance in metapopulations when considering the importance of so far overlooked stress resistance evolution. We thus provide evidence that metapopulation-level selection maximises individual performance and more importantly, that - at least in our system - evolutionary changes impact metapopulation dynamics, especially factors related to local and metapopulation sizes.},

This process relies on two coevolving conventions: a “sender code” that determines what kind of signal is to be sent given the sender's state; and a “receiver code” that determines the appropriate responses to different signal types. By means of a simple but generic model, we show that polymorphic sender and receiver strategies emerge naturally during the evolution of communication, and that the number of alternative strategies observed at equilibrium depends on the potential for error in signal production. Our model suggests that alternative communication strategies will evolve whenever senders possess imperfect information about their own quality or state, signals are costly, and genetic mechanisms allow for a correlation between sender and receiver behavior. These findings provide an explanation for recent reports of individual differences in communication strategies, and suggest that the amount of individual variation that can be expected in communication systems depends on the type of information being conveyed. Our model also suggests a link between communication and the evolution of animal personalities, which is that individual differences in the production and interpretation of signals can result in consistent differences in behavior.},

Researchers have long attempted to follow animals as they move through their environment. Until relatively recently, however, such efforts were limited to short distances and times in species large enough to carry large batteries and transmitters. New technologies have opened up new frontiers in animal tracking remote data collection. Hussey et al. review the unique directions such efforts have taken for marine systems, while Kays et al. review recent advances for terrestrial species. We have entered a new era of animal ecology, where animals act as both subjects and samplers of their environments.

abstract = {Animal orientation relative to incident solar radiation allows an animal to effectively adjust the amount of radiant heat gained from an environment. Yet recent literature found ruminants to primarily orientate north/south and proposed magnetic alignment as the most parsimonious explanation. To test whether such northerly orientation has an energy advantage, we used heated cylindrical models to estimate energy costs of thermoregulation associated with north and east orientations of three species of African ruminants under cool winter conditions. Concurrent behavioural observations revealed that eland, blue wildebeest and impala did not preferentially orientate north/south during warm summer or cool winter conditions. Instead, all three species preferred to orientate perpendicular to incident solar radiation during winter and parallel to incident solar radiation during summer, throughout the day. On clear winter days with little wind, more than 60{\%} of animal orientation preference could be accounted for by the energy savings associated with that orientation. Thus energy demands are likely to be the primary driver of animal orientation preferences.},

abstract = {Physiological stress responses allow individuals to adapt to changes in their status or surroundings, but chronic exposure to stressors could have detrimental effects. Increased stress hormone secretion leads to short-term escape behavior; however, no studies have assessed the potential of longer-term escape behavior, when individuals are in a chronic physiological state. Such refuge behavior is likely to take two forms, where an individual or population restricts its space use patterns spatially (spatial refuge hypothesis), or alters its use of space temporally (temporal refuge hypothesis). We tested the spatial and temporal refuge hypotheses by comparing space use patterns among three African elephant populations maintaining different fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) concentrations. In support of the spatial refuge hypothesis, the elephant population that maintained elevated FGM concentrations (iSimangaliso) used 20{\%} less of its reserve than did an elephant population with lower FGM concentrations (Pilanesberg) in a reserve of similar size, and 43{\%} less than elephants in the smaller Phinda reserve. We found mixed support for the temporal refuge hypothesis; home range sizes in the iSimangaliso population did not differ by day compared to nighttime, but elephants used areas within their home ranges differently between day and night. Elephants in all three reserves generally selected forest and woodland habitats over grasslands, but elephants in iSimangaliso selected exotic forest plantations over native habitat types. Our findings suggest that chronic stress is associated with restricted space use and altered habitat preferences that resemble a facultative refuge behavioral response. Elephants can maintain elevated FGM levels for ≥ 6 years following translocation, during which they exhibit refuge behavior that is likely a result of human disturbance and habitat conditions. Wildlife managers planning to translocate animals, or to initiate other management activities that could result in chronic stress responses, should consider the potential for, and consequences of, refuge behavior.},

This is particularly challenging for wide-ranging terrestrial canid and felid predators, which can each affect ecosystem structure through distinct hunting modes. To compare free-ranging pursuit and escape performance from group-hunting and solitary predators in unprecedented detail, we calibrated and deployed accelerometer-GPS collars during predator-prey chase sequences using packs of hound dogs ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Canis lupus familiaris{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} , 26 kg, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}  = 4–5 per chase) pursuing simultaneously instrumented solitary pumas ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Puma concolor{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} , 60 kg, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}  = 2). We then reconstructed chase paths, speed and turning angle profiles, and energy demands for hounds and pumas to examine performance and physiological constraints associated with cursorial and cryptic hunting modes, respectively. Interaction dynamics revealed how pumas successfully utilized terrain (e.g., fleeing up steep, wooded hillsides) as well as evasive maneuvers (e.g., jumping into trees, running in figure-8 patterns) to increase their escape distance from the overall faster hounds (avg. 2.3× faster). These adaptive strategies were essential to evasion in light of the mean 1.6× higher mass-specific energetic costs of the chase for pumas compared to hounds (mean: 0.76 {\textless}italic{\textgreater}vs.{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} 1.29 kJ kg {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}  min {\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} , respectively).

abstract = {In arctic and alpine environments, warm summer temperatures may force a reduction in foraging time of large herbivores, whose tolerance for heat is lower than for species adapted to warmer weather. We constructed time budgets for marked ibex (Capra ibex) males over two summers to test whether warm temperatures constrained foraging behaviour and forced altitudinal migrations. As daily temperature and solar radiation increased, feeding activity was reduced at midday and evening, but increased in the early morning, probably to anticipate for an expected reduction in foraging later in the day. With increasing temperature and solar radiation, ibex moved to higher elevations where they spent very little time feeding. Changes in forage quality and availability could not explain altitudinal migration. Temperatures above 15-20 degrees C apparently result in heat discomfort in male Alpine ibex. As temperature and solar radiation increased, older and larger ibex spent less time feeding during daylight and showed a steeper decrease in feeding time than younger and smaller ibex. Larger males may be more sensitive to temperature and solar radiation, or may have more flexibility in allocating time to different activities, given their lower relative energetic requirements.},

abstract = {The way in which animals move and use the landscape is influenced by the spatial distribution of resources, and is of importance when considering species conservation. We aimed at exploring how landscape-related factors affect a large herbivore's space-use patterns by using a combined approach, integrating movement (displacement and recursions) and habitat selection analyses. We studied the endangered Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus) in the Negev Desert, Israel, using GPS monitoring and direct observation. We found that the main landscape-related factors affecting the species' space-use patterns, on a daily and seasonal basis, were vegetation cover, water sources and topography. Two main habitat types were selected: high-elevation sites during the day (specific microclimate: windy on warm summer days) and streambed surroundings during the night (coupled with high vegetation when the animals were active in summer). Distribution of recursion times (duration between visits) revealed a 24-hour periodicity, a pattern that could be widespread among large herbivores. Characterizing frequently revisited sites suggested that recursion movements were mainly driven by a few landscape features (water sources, vegetation patches, high-elevation points), but also by social factors, such as territoriality, which should be further explored. This study provided complementary insights into the space-use patterns of E. hemionus. Understanding of the species' space-use patterns, at both large and fine spatial scale, is required for developing appropriate conservation protocols. Our approach could be further applied for studying the space-use patterns of other species in heterogeneous landscapes.},

abstract = {Most organisms need to acquire various resources to survive and reproduce. Individuals should adjust their behavior to make optimal use of the landscape and limit the costs of trade-offs emerging from the use of these resources. Here we study how African elephants Loxodonta africana travel to foraging places between regular visits to waterholes. Elephant herds were tracked using GPS collars during two consecutive dry seasons in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. We segmented each individual movement track at each visit to water to define foraging trips, and then used trip-level statistics to build an understanding of movement strategies. Travel speed within these individually-consistent movement bouts was also analyzed to understand if speed was better linked to distance to water or progression in the trip over time. We found that elephants went further from water when drinking less often, which could result from a trade-off between drinking and foraging in less depleted, far from water, places. Speed increased towards the beginning and the end of the trips, and was also greater than observed during the wet season, suggesting that elephants were trying to save time. Numerous short trips traveled at greater speed, particularly when commuting to a different waterhole, was tentatively explained by the inability to drink at specific waterholes due to intra-specific interference. Unexpectedly elephants did not always minimize travel time by drinking at the closest waterhole, but the extra distance traveled remained never more than a few kilometers. Our results show how individuals may adjust movement behavior to deal with resource trade-offs at the landscape scale. We also highlight how behavioral context, here progression in the trip, may be more important than spatial context, here distance to water, in explaining animal movement patterns.},

abstract = {The annual migration cycle of waterbirds often involves several distinct movement stages, for example within-winter movements or the moult migration during summer, which require a high degree of individual flexibility in migration direction. Here, we investigate whether such flexibility is a common characteristic of waterbird migration by analysing movement behaviour of a dabbling duck, the gadwall Anas strepera, during the little studied, intermediate autumn period. The tracking of individuals via satellite transmitters (n = 7) as well as the ring re-encounter analysis of three European gadwall populations (Germany, England, Russia) revealed that autumn movements were multidirectional. Furthermore, the comparison with winter re-encounters suggested that autumn movements were partly independent of the movements towards subsequently used south to southwestern wintering areas. Some individuals even travelled long distances north- or eastwards. Accordingly, some autumn locations were characterized by a harsh climate, thus serving as temporary staging sites but necessitating further movements when wetlands freeze during winter. The occurrence of such detours or reversals of migration was confirmed by the transmitter data. Inter-individual variability in distance and direction of autumn movements was found for both sexes and age-classes indicating that gadwalls, in general, followed flexible movement strategies. Based on the extent of multidirectional autumn movements, we hypothesize important benefits of such flights and suggest that the analysis of year-round movement patterns of individual animals during their distinct life-history stages is essential to understand how they can successfully reproduce and survive.},

abstract = {Understanding the environmental factors influencing animal movements is fundamental to theoretical and applied research in the field of movement ecology. Studies relating fine-scale movement paths to spatiotemporally structured landscape data, such as vegetation productivity or human activity, are particularly lacking despite the obvious importance of such information to understanding drivers of animal movement. In part, this may be because few approaches provide the sophistication to characterize the complexity of movement behavior and relate it to diverse, varying environmental stimuli. We overcame this hurdle by applying, for the first time to an ecological question, a finite impulse-response signal-filtering approach to identify human and natural environmental drivers of movements of 13 free-ranging African elephants (Loxodonta africana) from distinct social groups collected over seven years. A minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation criterion allowed comparison of the predictive power of landscape and ecological model inputs. We showed that a filter combining vegetation dynamics, human and physical landscape features, and previous movement outperformed simpler filter structures, indicating the importance of both dynamic and static landscape features, as well as habit, on movement decisions taken by elephants. Elephant responses to vegetation productivity indices were not uniform in time or space, indicating that elephant foraging strategies are more complex than simply gravitation toward areas of high productivity. Predictions were most frequently inaccurate outside protected area boundaries near human settlements, suggesting that human activity disrupts typical elephant movement behavior. Successful management strategies at the human-elephant interface, therefore, are likely to be context specific and dynamic. Signal processing provides a promising approach for elucidating environmental factors that drive animal movements over large time and spatial scales.},

The potential role of fire as a stochastic mass-mortality event limiting these populations is poorly understood, so too the behavioural and physiological responses of the affected animals to this type of large disturbance event. During September 2005, a wildfire resulted in mortality of 29 (18{\%} population mortality) and injury to 18, African elephants in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. We examined movement and herd association patterns of six GPS-collared breeding herds, and evaluated population physiological response through faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (stress) levels. We investigated population size, structure and projected growth rates using a simulation model. After an initial flight response post-fire, severely injured breeding herds reduced daily displacement with increased daily variability, reduced home range size, spent more time in non-tourist areas and associated less with other herds. Uninjured, or less severely injured, breeding herds also shifted into non-tourist areas post-fire, but in contrast, increased displacement rate (both mean and variability), did not adjust home range size and formed larger herds post-fire. Adult cow stress hormone levels increased significantly post-fire, whereas juvenile and adult bull stress levels did not change significantly. Most mortality occurred to the juvenile age class causing a change in post-fire population age structure. Projected population growth rate remained unchanged at 6.5{\%} p.a., and at current fecundity levels, the population would reach its previous level three to four years post-fire. The natural mortality patterns seen in elephant populations during stochastic events, such as droughts, follows that of the classic mortality pattern seen in predator-free large ungulate populations, i.e. mainly involving juveniles. Fire therefore functions in a similar manner to other environmental catastrophes and may be a natural mechanism contributing to population limitation. Welfare concerns of arson fires, burning during "hot-fire" conditions and the conservation implications of fire suppression (i.e. removal of a potential contributing factor to natural population regulation) should be integrated into fire management strategies for conservation areas.},

abstract = {In this mini-review, we discuss how biologging technology can be used to detect, understand, and forecast species' responses to climate change. We review studies of phenology, thermal biology, and microhabitat selection as examples to illustrate the utility of a biologging approach in terrestrial and aquatic species. These examples show that biologgers can be used to identify and predict behavioral and physiological responses to climatic variation and directional climate change, as well as to extreme weather events. While there is still considerable debate as to whether phenotypic plasticity is sufficient to facilitate species' responses to climate change or whether responses to short-term climate variability are predictive of climate change response, understanding the scope and nature of plasticity is an important step towards answering these questions. One advantage of the biologging approach is that it can facilitate the measurement of traits at the level of the individual, permitting research that investigates the degree to which physiology and behavior are plastic. As such, combining biologging with metrics of fitness can provide insight into how plasticity might confer population and species resilience to climate change. Increased use of biologgers in experimental manipulations will also yield important insight into how phenotypic flexibility allows some animals to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change. Although biologging studies to date have mostly functioned in measuring phenotypic responses to short-term climate variability, we argue that integrating biologging technology into long-term monitoring programs will be instrumental in documenting and understanding ecological responses to climate change.},

abstract = {The largest land mammals are constrained in their activities by their large body size, a theme that is emphasized in this account of their general ecology. The book begins by raising the question as to why these once abundant and widely distributed 'megaherbivores' - elephants, rhinos, hippos and giraffes - have all but gone extinct, and ends by considering the implications of the answer for the conservation of the remaining populations. Existing megaherbivores are placed in the context of the more numerous species which occurred worldwide until the end of the last Ice Age, and knowledge of the ecology of surviving species is used to analyse the cause of the extinctions. The information and ideas contained in this book are of crucial importance to all concerned with halting the rapidly worsening conservation status of remaining elephant and rhinoceros species, and carries a wider message for those concerned with the ramifying effects of man on ecosystem processes. Graduate students and research scientists in ecology, conservation biology and wildlife management will find this book of value.},

abstract = {Elephant movement patterns in relation to surface water demonstrate that they are a water-dependent species. Thus, there has been interest in using surface water management to mitigate problems associated with localized elephant overabundance. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying the elephant's water dependence remain unclear. Although thermoregulation is likely an important driver, the relationship between thermoregulation, water use and climate has not been quantified. We measured skin surface temperature of and cutaneous water loss from 13 elephants (seven African, 3768±642 kg; six Asian, 3834±498 kg) and determined the contribution of evaporative cooling to their thermal and water budgets across a range of air temperatures (8-33°C). We also measured respiratory evaporative water loss and resting metabolic heat production on a subset of elephants (N=7). The rate of cutaneous evaporative water loss ranged between 0.31 and 8.9 g min(-1) m(-2) for Asian elephants and 0.26 and 6.5 g min(-1) m(-2) for African elephants. Simulated thermal and water budgets using climate data from Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and Okaukuejo, Namibia, suggested that the 24-h evaporative cooling water debt incurred in warm climates can be more than 4.5 times that incurred in mesic climates. This study confirms elephants are obligate evaporative coolers but suggests that classification of elephants as water dependent is insufficient given the importance of climate in determining the magnitude of this dependence. These data highlight the potential for a physiological modeling approach to predicting the utility of surface water management for specific populations.},

abstract = {The costs and benefits of stalking and chasing
Organisms live under a constant balance between getting and using energy. Large carnivores may feel this balance more acutely because of the large amounts of energy needed to capture and subdue their prey. Williams et al. and Scantlebury et al. used remote measures of physiology and behavior to identify the hunting strategies of the stalking North American puma and the speedy African cheetah (see the Perspective by Laundr{\'{e}}). In both cases the cats' hunting strategies are well matched to produce a balance between the energy they spend on the hunt and the energy they acquire from their prey, despite their very different strategies and levels of competition.
Science, this issue p. 81, p. 79; see also p. 33
Population viability is driven by individual survival, which in turn depends on individuals balancing energy budgets. As carnivores may function close to maximum sustained power outputs, decreased food availability or increased activity may render some populations energetically vulnerable. Prey theft may compromise energetic budgets of mesopredators, such as cheetahs and wild dogs, which are susceptible to competition from larger carnivores. We show that daily energy expenditure (DEE) of cheetahs was similar to size-based predictions and positively related to distance traveled. Theft at 25{\%} only requires cheetahs to hunt for an extra 1.1 hour per day, increasing DEE by just 12{\%}. Therefore, not all mesopredators are energetically constrained by direct competition. Other factors that increase DEE, such as those that increase travel, may be more important for population viability.
Cheetahs' approach to hunting their prey can resist competition from other predators. [Also see Perspective by Laundr{\'{e}}]

abstract = {1. Despite the identification of internal state as a fundamental component of animal movement, the effect of an individual's internal physiological state on movement remains poorly understood. African elephants (Loxodonta africana) alter their behaviour in response to their physiological state, and elevated stress hormone concentrations have been associated with reclusive behaviour and aggression towards humans. Thus, a better understanding of the link between internal physiological state and movement is important in advancing the field of movement ecology, and the ecology and management of elephants. 2. We compared the movement paths of African elephants in two physiological states (basal and elevated stress hormone levels) to understand the variation in the use of space in relation to the proximity of environmental features and refugia. 3. We documented differences in the elephants' use of space along movement paths by physiological state. Elephant family groups in a basal physiological state tended to venture away from refugia and commercial tree plantations, and use areas in closer proximity to fresh water. In contrast, elephant family groups in an elevated physiological state tended to use areas near refugia and commercial tree plantations. The use of commercial tree plantations during elevated states highlights an important concern for human safety in the context of human– elephant conflict. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings suggest that fine-scale movement patterns and the use of specific environmental features by elephants are associated with differences in elephant physiological state. Therefore, future attempts to describe or predict typically complex animal movement could be enhanced by incorporating measures of their physiological state. Given that elephants are more prone to habitat disturbance and aggression when in an elevated physiological state, information about elephant movement behaviour could be used in combination with real-time tracking data to predict when and where elephants are potentially in elevated physiological states and limit human access to these areas, which might mitigate human– elephant conflict.},

abstract = {In arid regions of the southwestern United States, water is often considered a primary factor limiting distribution and productivity of desert ungulates, including desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana). Thus, wildlife management agencies and sportsmen's organizations have invested substantial time and resources in the construction arid maintenance of water catchments. Although the availability of freestanding water sources is believed to influence many aspects of the ecology of desert bighorn sheep, the efficacy of these water sources has been questioned arid his not been examined experimentally. We used a before-after-control-impact study design to determine if removal of water catchments changed diet, characteristics of foraging areas used by female desert bighorn sheep, home-range size, movement rates, distance to catchments, adult mortality, productivity, or juvenile recruitment in 2 mountain ranges on the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona, USA. During pretreatment (2002-2003), we ensured that water catchments were available to desert bighorn sheep in both mountain ranges; during posttreatment (2004-2005), we drained all water catchments in the treatment range. We measured diet composition, characteristics of foraging areas, 50{\%} and 95{\%} kernel home ranges, movement rates, and distance to water catchments seasonally from 2002 to 2005. We also estimated adult survival, lamb:female, and yearling:female ratios from 2002 to 2005. We predicted that removal of water catchments would result in 1) increased use of foraging areas with more vegetation cover, more thermal cover, and higher succulent abundance; 2) increased consumption of cacti and other succulents; 3) an increase in home-range size, movement rates, and distance to nearest catchment; and 4) a decrease in adult survival, productivity, and juvenile recruitment. Removal of water catchments in the treatment range did not result in predicted changes in diet, foraging area selection, home-range size, movement rates, mortality, productivity, or recruitment. Female desert bighorn sheep did use areas with more thermal cover during the summer after removal of water catchments, but other characteristics of foraging areas used by bighorn sheep and their diet did not change appreciably with removal of water catchments. We did not document changes in home-range area, movement rates, or distance sheep were from water during hotter months; we only documented changes in home-range area, movement rates, and distance to water catchments during winter and autumn. There were 10 desert bighorn sheep mortalities in the treatment range and 8 in the control range; 7 mortalities in each mountain range were during pretreatment. Twelve of the 18 total mortalities occurred during summer. Survival rate was lower during pretreatment than posttreatment in both mountain ranges. We did not document increased mortality or a change in lamb:female or yearling:female ratios after removal of water catchments. Home-range area and movement rates declined with increasing precipitation. Annual Survival rites increased with increases in the current year's total precipitation and total precipitation during the previous year; annual survival rates declined with increases in average daily temperature during winter. There was a severe drought during pretreatment and abnormally wet conditions during posttreatment. The increase in precipitation that coincided with removal of water sources improved forage conditions during posttreatment arid many have provided adequate water for female desert bighorn shep. The lick of change in home-range size, movement rates, and distance to the nearest water catchment during hot, dry seasons after removal of water sources suggests that forage conditions played a greater role in determining home-range area arid movement rates than did the presence of water catchments. Higher mortality rates during the drought of the pretreatment period indicates that during droughts as severe as that of 2002, presence of water catchments was not sufficient to prevent mortalities of desert bighorn sheep and a lack of forage quality and quantity was likely the primary limiting factor of the population during this time. Improving forage conditions during posttreatment, increases in forage moisture content, and availability of naturally occurring sources of free water in the treatment range likely minimized any impact of removing water catchments on survival rates and lamb:female and yearling:female ratios. However, due to the climatic conditions during the study we were unable to assess how the treatment population would have responded to a lack of water sources during a drought period. The influence of anthropogenic water catchments, if any, Oil desert bighorn sheep populations may be strongest during years with weather conditions that are neither drought nor wet periods. Given the high interannual variability in precipitation in many areas of the and Southwest, it is important for wildlife managers to determine if and when water is the primary limiting factor for populations of desert bighorn sheep in order to make the most efficient use of agency time and resources.},

abstract = {Opinions are divided as to whether human intervention to control elephant (Loxodonta africana) population growth is desirable, partly because of elephant welfare concerns. Female contraception through immunization with porcine zona pellucida (PZP) proteins is viable. The effects of sustained use and application of the PZP vaccine on elephant behavioral and spatial responses were examined by evaluating herd ranging, fission-fusion dynamics, association patterns, and reproductive and sexual behaviors. Minimal change was anticipated as a result of long calf dependence on and association with cows, a reduced but not indefinite 0{\%} growth rate and the known mechanism of action of PZP vaccines, and minimal expected change in resource requirements necessitating behavioral or spatial use adaptations. Although behavioral effects identified in previous hormonal contraceptive trials were evident, it was demonstrated that immunocontraception caused no prolonged behavioral, social, or spatial changes over the 11-yr study period. Individually identified elephants were monitored from 1999 to 2011. Minimal, short-term social disruption, with temporary changes to the herds' core ranges, was observed during the annual treatment events, particularly in the first three treatment years, when vaccinations were conducted exclusively from the ground. Thereafter, when vaccinations were conducted aerially, minor disruptions were confined to the morning of administration only. Despite sustained treatments resulting in demographic changes of fewer calves being born, treatments did not alter spatial range use, and no adverse interherd-intraherd relations were observed. Similarly, resource requirements did not change as calving still occurred, although in fewer numbers. It was concluded that PZP immunocontraception has no detectable behavioral or social consequences in elephants over the course of 11 yr, providing a convincing argument for the use of sustained immunocontraception in the medium to long term as an important tool for elephant management. Behavioral consequences of alternative management approaches should all receive similar scrutiny to enable managers to make informed decisions when weighing management interventions.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in using dynamic social networks in the study of animal sociality and its consequences. However, there is a general lack of guidance on the when and how such an approach will be valuable. The aim of this paper is to provide a guide on when to choose dynamic vs. static social network analysis, and how to choose the appropriate temporal scale for the dynamic network. I first discuss the motivations for using dynamic animal social networks. I then provide guidance on how to choose between dynamic networks and the “standard” approach of using static networks. I discuss this in the context of the temporal scale of changes observed, of their predictability and of the data availability. Dynamic networks are important in a number of scenarios. First, if the network data are being compared to independent processes, such as the spread of information or disease or environmental changes, then dynamic networks will provide more accurate estimates of spreading rates. Second, if the network has predictable patterns of change, for example diel cycles or seasonal changes, then dynamic networks should be used to capture the impact of these changes. Third, dynamic networks are important for studies of spread through networks when the relationship between edge weight and transmission probability is nonlinear. Finally, dynamic social networks are also useful in situations where interactions among individuals are dense, such as in studies of captive groups. The use of static vs. dynamic network requires careful consideration, both from a research question perspective and from a data perspective, and this paper provides a guide on how to evaluate the relative importance of these.},

Increasingly, studies of behav iour or ecology explore the function of particular responses or patterns of behaviour in individuals or populations - looking for the adaptiveness that has led to the adoption of such patterns either at a proximate level (what environmental circumstances have favoured the adoption of some particular strategy or response from within the animal's repertoire at that specific time) or at an evolutionary level (speculating upon what pres sures have led to the inclusion of a particular pattern of behaviour within the repertoire in the first place). Many common principles have been established - common to a wide diversity of animal groups, yet showing some precise relationship between a given aspect of behaviour or population dynamics and some particular ecological factor. In particular, tremendous advances have been made in understanding the foraging behaviour of animals - and the 'decision rules' by which they seek and select from the various resources on offer - and patterns of social organization and behaviour: the adap tiveness of different social structures, group sizes or reproductive tactics.},

The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin-plate spline smoothing problem, and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin-plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation is computationally efficient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin-plate spline models with large datasets; avoid the problems associated with " knot placement " that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines; provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in GAMs; provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large datasets; provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efficiency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin-plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating un-penalized spline like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.},

abstract = {1.Neutral landscape models ({\{}NLMs{\}}) simulate landscape patterns based on theoretical distributions and can be used to systematically study the effect of landscape structure on ecological processes. {\{}NLMs{\}} are commonly used in landscape ecology to enhance the findings of field studies as well as in simulation studies to provide an underlying landscape. However, their creation so far has been limited to software that is platform dependent, does not allow a reproducible workflow or is not embedded in R, the prevailing programming language used by ecologists. 2.Here, we present two complementary R packages {\{}NLMR{\}} and landscapetools, that allow users to generate and manipulate {\{}NLMs{\}} in a single environment. They grant the simulation of the widest collection of {\{}NLMs{\}} found in any single piece of software thus far while allowing for easy manipulation in a self-contained and reproducible workflow. The combination of both packages should stimulate a wider usage of {\{}NLMs{\}} in ecology. {\{}NLMR{\}} is a comprehensive collection of algorithms with which to simulate {\{}NLMs{\}}. landscapetools provides a utility toolbox which facilitates an easy workflow with simulated neutral landscapes and other raster data. 3.We show two example applications that illustrate potential use cases for {\{}NLMR{\}} and landscapetools: First, an agent-based simulation study in which the effect of spatial structure on disease persistence was studied. The second example shows how increases in spatial scaling can introduce biases in calculated landscape metrics. 4.Simplifying the workflow around generating and handling {\{}NLMs{\}} should encourage an uptake in the usage of {\{}NLMs{\}}. {\{}NLMR{\}} and landscapetools are both generic frameworks that can be used in a variety of applications and are a further step to having a unified simulation environment in R for answering spatial research questions.

abstract = {Surface water is one of the constraining resources for herbivore populations in semi-arid regions. Artificial waterpoints are constructed by wildlife managers to supplement natural water supplies, to support herbivore populations. The aim of this paper is to analyse how a landowner may realize his ecological and economic goals by manipulating waterpoints for the management of an elephant population, a water-dependent species in the presence of water-independent species. We develop a theoretical bio-economic framework to analyse the optimization of wildlife management objectives (in this case revenue generation from both consumptive and non-consumptive use and biodiversity conservation), using waterpoint construction as a control variable. The model provides a bio-economic framework for analysing optimization problems where a control has direct effects on one herbivore species but indirect effects on the other. A landowner may be interested only in maximization of profits either from elephant offtake and/or tourism revenue, ignoring the negative effects that could be brought about by elephants to biodiversity. If the landowner does not take the indirect effects of waterpoints into consideration, then the game reserve management, as the authority entrusted with the sustainable management of the game reserve, might use economic instruments such as subsidies or taxes to the landowners to enforce sound waterpoint management.},

abstract = {Habitat selection models are used in ecology to link the distribution of animals to environmental covariates, and identify habitats that are important for conservation. The most widely used models of this type, resource selection functions, assume independence between the observed locations of an animal. This is unrealistic when location data display spatio-temporal autocorrelation. Alternatively, step selection functions embed habitat selection in a model of animal movement, to account for the autocorrelation. However, inferences from step selection functions depend on the movement model, and they cannot readily be used to predict long-term space use. We recently suggested that a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm could define a step selection model with an explicit stationary distribution: the target distribution. Here, we explain how the likelihood of a MCMC step selection model is derived, and how maximum likelihood estimation can be used for inference about parameters of movement and habitat selection. We describe the local Gibbs sampler, a rejection-free MCMC scheme designed to capture important features of real animal movement. The sampler can be used as the basis for a flexible class of movement models, and we derive the likelihood function for several important special cases. In a simulation study, we verify that maximum likelihood estimation can be used to recover all model parameters. We illustrate the application of the method with data from a plains zebra.},

abstract = {The idea that low surface densities of hairs could be a heat loss mechanism is understood in engineering and has been postulated in some thermal studies of animals. However, its biological implications, both for thermoregulation as well as for the evolution of epidermal structures, have not yet been noted. Since early epidermal structures are poorly preserved in the fossil record, we study modern elephants to infer not only the heat transfer effect of present-day sparse hair, but also its potential evolutionary origins. Here we use a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches, and a range of hair densities determined from photographs, to test whether sparse hairs increase convective heat loss from elephant skin, thus serving an intentional evolutionary purpose. Our conclusion is that elephants are covered with hair that significantly enhances their thermoregulation ability by over 5{\%} under all scenarios considered, and by up to 23{\%} at low wind speeds where their thermoregulation needs are greatest. The broader biological significance of this finding suggests that maintaining a low-density hair cover can be evolutionary purposeful and beneficial, which is consistent with the fact that elephants have the greatest need for heat loss of any modern terrestrial animal because of their high body-volume to skin-surface ratio. Elephant hair is the first documented example in nature where increasing heat transfer due to a low hair density covering may be a desirable effect, and therefore raises the possibility of such a covering for similarly sized animals in the past. This elephant example dispels the widely-held assumption that in modern endotherms body hair functions exclusively as an insulator and could therefore be a first step to resolving the prior paradox of why hair was able to evolve in a world much warmer than our own.},

abstract = {1. Despite the identification of internal state as a fundamental component of animal movement, the effect of an individual's internal physiological state on movement remains poorly understood. African elephants (Loxodonta africana) alter their behaviour in response to their physiological state, and elevated stress hormone concentrations have been associated with reclusive behaviour and aggression towards humans. Thus, a better understanding of the link between internal physiological state and movement is important in advancing the field of movement ecology, and the ecology and management of elephants. 2. We compared the movement paths of African elephants in two physiological states (basal and elevated stress hormone levels) to understand the variation in the use of space in relation to the proximity of environmental features and refugia. 3. We documented differences in the elephants' use of space along movement paths by physiological state. Elephant family groups in a basal physiological state tended to venture away from refugia and commercial tree plantations, and use areas in closer proximity to fresh water. In contrast, elephant family groups in an elevated physiological state tended to use areas near refugia and commercial tree plantations. The use of commercial tree plantations during elevated states highlights an important concern for human safety in the context of human– elephant conflict. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings suggest that fine-scale movement patterns and the use of specific environmental features by elephants are associated with differences in elephant physiological state. Therefore, future attempts to describe or predict typically complex animal movement could be enhanced by incorporating measures of their physiological state. Given that elephants are more prone to habitat disturbance and aggression when in an elevated physiological state, information about elephant movement behaviour could be used in combination with real-time tracking data to predict when and where elephants are potentially in elevated physiological states and limit human access to these areas, which might mitigate human– elephant conflict.},

abstract = {Movement influences a myriad of ecological processes operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Yet our understanding of animal movement is limited by the resolution of data that can be obtained from individuals. Traditional approaches implicitly assume that movement decisions are made at the spatial and temporal scales of observation, although this scale is typically an artifact of data-gathering technology rather than biological realism. To address this limitation, we used telemetry-based movement data for caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in Newfoundland, Canada, and compared movement decisions estimated at the temporal resolution of GPS relocations (2 hours) to a novel model describing directional movement to areas reachable over an extended period. We showed that this newer model is a better predictor of movement decisions by caribou, with decisions made at the scale of ∼2 km, including the strong avoidance of dense coniferous forest, an outcome not detectable at the scale of GPS relocations. These results illustrate the complexity of factors affecting animal movement decisions and the analytical challenges associated with their interpretation. Our novel modelling framework will help support increased accuracy in predictive models of animal space-use, and thereby aid in determining biologically meaningful scales for collecting movement and habitat data.},

abstract = {Most ecosystems have multiple predator species that not only compete for shared prey, but also pose direct threats to each other. These intraguild interactions are key drivers of carnivore community structure, with ecosystem-wide cascading effects. Yet, behavioral mechanisms for coexistence of multiple carnivore species remain poorly understood. The challenges of studying large, free-ranging carnivores have resulted in mainly coarse-scale examination of behavioral strategies without information about all interacting competitors. We overcame some of these challenges by examining the concurrent fine-scale movement decisions of almost all individuals of four large mammalian carnivore species in a closed terrestrial system. We found that the intensity ofintraguild interactions did not follow a simple hierarchical allometric pattern, because spatial and behavioral tactics of subordinate species changed with threat and resource levels across seasons. Lions (Panthera leo) were generally unrestricted and anchored themselves in areas rich in not only their principal prey, but also, during periods of resource limitation (dry season), rich in the main prey for other carnivores. Because of this, the greatest cost (potential intraguild predation) for subordinate carnivores was spatially coupled with the highest potential benefit of resource acquisition (prey-rich areas), especially in the dry season. Leopard (P. pardus) and cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) overlapped with the home range of lions but minimized their risk using fine-scaled avoidance behaviors and restricted resource acquisition tactics. The cost of intraguild competition was most apparent for cheetahs, especially during the wet season, as areas with energetically rewarding large prey (wildebeest) were avoided when they overlapped highly with the activity areas of lions. Contrary to expectation, the smallest species (African wild dog, Lycaon pictus) did not avoid only lions, but also used multiple tactics to minimize encountering all other competitors. Intraguild competition thus forced wild dogs into areas with the lowest resource availability year round. Coexistence of multiple carnivore species has typically been explained by dietary niche separation, but our multi-scaled movement results suggest that differences in resource acquisition may instead be a consequence of avoiding intraguild competition. We generate a more realistic representation of hierarchical behavioral interactions that may ultimately drive spatially explicit trophic structures of multi-predator communities.},

abstract = {Studies aimed at explaining the evolution of phenotypic traits have often solely focused on fitness considerations, ignoring underlying mechanisms. In recent years, there has been an increasing call for integrating mechanistic perspectives in evolutionary considerations, but it is not clear whether and how mechanisms affect the course and outcome of evolution. To study this, we compare four mechanistic implementations of two well-studied models for the evolution of cooperation, the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game and the Iterated Snowdrift (ISD) game. Behavioural strategies are either implemented by a 1 : 1 genotype–phenotype mapping or by a simple neural network. Moreover, we consider two different scenarios for the effect of mutations. The same set of strategies is feasible in all four implementations, but the probability that a given strategy arises owing to mutation is largely dependent on the behavioural and genetic architecture. Our individual-based simulations show that this has major implications for the evolutionary outcome. In the ISD, different evolutionarily stable strategies are predominant in the four implementations, while in the IPD each implementation creates a characteristic dynamical pattern. As a consequence, the evolved average level of cooperation is also strongly dependent on the underlying mechanism. We argue that our findings are of general relevance for the evolution of social behaviour, pleading for the integration of a mechanistic perspective in models of social evolution.},

abstract = {The automation of agricultural mapping using satellite-derived remotely sensed data remains a challenge in Africa because of the heterogeneous and fragmental landscape, complex crop cycles, and limited access to local knowledge. Currently, consistent, continent-wide routine cropland mapping of Africa does not exist, with most studies focused either on certain portions of the continent or at most a one-time effort at mapping the continent at coarse resolution remote sensing. In this research, we addressed these limitations by applying an automated cropland mapping algorithm (ACMA) that captures extensive knowledge on the croplands of Africa available through: (a) ground-based training samples, (b) very high (sub-meter to five-meter) resolution imagery (VHRI), and (c) local knowledge captured during field visits and/or sourced from country reports and literature. The study used 16-day time-series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composited data at 250-m resolution for the entire African continent. Based on these data, the study first produced accurate reference cropland layers or RCLs (cropland extent/areas, irrigation versus rainfed, cropping intensities, crop dominance, and croplands versus cropland fallows) for the year 2014 that provided an overall accuracy of around 90{\%} for crop extent in different agro-ecological zones (AEZs). The RCLs for the year 2014 (RCL2014) were then used in the development of the ACMA algorithm to create ACMA-derived cropland layers for 2014 (ACL2014). ACL2014 when compared pixel-by-pixel with the RCL2014 had an overall similarity greater than 95{\%}. Based on the ACL2014, the African continent had 296Mha of net cropland areas (260Mha cultivated plus 36Mha fallows) and 330Mha of gross cropland areas. Of the 260Mha of net cropland areas cultivated during 2014, 90.6{\%} (236Mha) was rainfed and just 9.4{\%} (24Mha) was irrigated. Africa has about 15{\%} of the world's population, but only about 6{\%} of world's irrigation. Net cropland area distribution was 95Mha during season 1, 117Mha during season 2, and 84Mha continuous. About 58{\%} of the rainfed and 39{\%} of the irrigated were single crops (net cropland area without cropland fallows) cropped during either season 1 (January-May) or season 2 (June-September). The ACMA algorithm was deployed on Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and applied on MODIS time-series data from 2003 through 2014 to obtain ACMA-derived cropland layers for these years (ACL2003 to ACL2014). The results indicated that over these twelve years, on average: (a) croplands increased by 1Mha/yr, and (b) cropland fallows decreased by 1Mha/year. Cropland areas computed from ACL2014 for the 55 African countries were largely underestimated when compared with an independent source of census-based cropland data, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.5Mha. ACMA demonstrated the ability to hind-cast (past years), now-cast (present year), and forecast (future years) cropland products using MODIS 250-m time-series data rapidly, but currently, insufficient reference data exist to rigorously report trends from these results.},

abstract = {Recent advances in bio-logging open promising perspectives in the study animal movements at numerous scales. It is now possible to record time-series of animal locations and ancillary data (e.g. activity level derived from on-board accelerometers) over extended areas and long durations with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Such time-series are often piecewise stationary, as the animal may alternate between different stationary phases (i.e. characterised by a specific mean and variance of some key parameter for limited periods). Identifying when these phases start and end is a critical first step to understand the dynamics of the underlying movement processes. We introduce a new segmentation-clustering method we called segclust2d. It can segment bi- (or more generally multi-) variate time-series and possibly cluster the various segments obtained, corresponding to phases assumed to be stationary. It is easy to use, as it only requires specifying the minimum length of a segment (to prevent over-segmentation) based on biological considerations. Although this method can be applied to time-series of any nature, we focus here on two-dimensional piecewise time-series whose phases correspond at small scale to the expressions of different behavioural modes such as transit, feeding and resting, as characterised by two joint metrics such as speed and turning angles or, at larger scale, to temporary home ranges, characterised by stationary distributions of bivariate coordinates. Using computer simulations, we show that segcust2d can rival and even outperform previous, more complex methods, which were specifically developed to highlight changes in movement modes or home range shifts (based on Hidden Markov or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck modelling, respectively), which, contrary to our method, require truly informative initial guesses to be efficient. Furthermore we demonstrate it on actual examples involving a zebra's small scale movements and an elephant's large scale movements, to illustrate the identification of various movement modes and of home range shifts, respectively.},

The correct statistical approach to assess this degree of agreement is not obvious. Correlation and regression studies are frequently proposed. However, correlation studies the relationship between one variable and another, not the differences, and it is not recommended as a method for assessing the comparability between methods.  In 1983 Altman and Bland (B{\&}A) proposed an alternative analysis, based on the quantification of the agreement between two quantitative measurements by studying the mean difference and constructing limits of agreement.  The B{\&}A plot analysis is a simple way to evaluate a bias between the mean differences, and to estimate an agreement interval, within which 95{\%} of the differences of the second method, compared to the first one, fall. Data can be analyzed both as unit differences plot and as percentage differences plot.  The B{\&}A plot method only defines the intervals of agreements, it does not say whether those limits are acceptable or not. Acceptable limits must be defined a priori, based on clinical necessity, biological considerations or other goals.  The aim of this article is to provide guidance on the use and interpretation of Bland Altman analysis in method comparison studies.},

abstract = {Integrating biomechanics, behavior and ecology requires a mechanistic understanding of the processes producing the movement of animals. This calls for contemporaneous biomechanical, behavioral and environmental data along movement pathways. A recently formulated unifying movement ecology paradigm facilitates the integration of existing biomechanics, optimality, cognitive and random paradigms for studying movement. We focus on the use of tri-axial acceleration (ACC) data to identify behavioral modes of GPS-tracked free-ranging wild animals and demonstrate its application to study the movements of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus, Hablizl 1783). In particular, we explore a selection of nonlinear and decision tree methods that include support vector machines, classification and regression trees, random forest methods and artificial neural networks and compare them with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a baseline for classifying behavioral modes. Using a dataset of 1035 ground-truthed ACC segments, we found that all methods can accurately classify behavior (80–90{\%}) and, as expected, all nonlinear methods outperformed LDA. We also illustrate how ACC-identified behavioral modes provide the means to examine how vulture flight is affected by environmental factors, hence facilitating the integration of behavioral, biomechanical and ecological data. Our analysis of just over three-quarters of a million GPS and ACC measurements obtained from 43 free-ranging vultures across 9783 vulture-days suggests that their annual breeding schedule might be selected primarily in response to seasonal conditions favoring rising-air columns (thermals) and that rare long-range forays of up to 1750 km from the home range are performed despite potentially heavy energetic costs and a low rate of food intake, presumably to explore new breeding, social and long-term resource location opportunities.},

abstract = {Elephants live in heterogeneous landscapes where they search for resources that conceivably will optimise their survival. The uneven distribution of such resources may be linked to landscape heterogeneity. I therefore hypothesized that landscape heterogeneity determines home range location and size. I evaluated home range sizes of elephants living in Etosha National Park (n = 6), Khaudum Game Reserve (n = 6) and Ngamiland District 11 (n = 4) during two wet and two dry seasons. I used landscape maps to quantify landscape heterogeneity based on five metrics calculated using FRAGSTATS and compared heterogeneity levels in elephant home ranges and randomly located ranges within each of the study areas. I further related elephant home range size to these landscape metrics and considered the relationship between home range size and water point density. Landscape metrics differed significantly between study areas. Elephants in Etosha and NG11 selected for Largest patch index, Landscape shape index, Contagion and Shannon diversity index, while those in Khaudum selected only for Largest patch index and Landscape shape index. Elephants therefore seem to locate their home ranges in areas of the landscape where higher levels of heterogeneity occur during wet and dry seasons. The results of this study further suggest that differences in home range size can best be explained by water point density. Heterogeneity is an inherent characteristic of landscapes and seems to reflect on the availability of resources that may subsequently influence the way elephants utilise space. My study supports the notion that management of elephants should be directed at ensuring the inclusion of heterogeneous landscapes in conservation areas and at reconsidering water management policies that may impair landscape selection. This may address local elephant impacts through local and regional movements driven by landscape selection.},

abstract = {Because empirical studies of animal movement are most-often site- and species-specific, we lack understanding of the level of consistency in movement patterns across diverse taxa, as well as a framework for quantitatively classifying movement patterns. We aim to address this gap by determining the extent to which statistical signatures of animal movement patterns recur across ecological systems. We assessed a suite of movement metrics derived from GPS trajectories of thirteen marine and terrestrial vertebrate species spanning three taxonomic classes, orders of magnitude in body size, and modes of movement (swimming, flying, walking). Using these metrics, we performed a principal components analysis and cluster analysis to determine if individuals organized into statistically distinct clusters. Finally, to identify and interpret commonalities within clusters, we compared them to computer-simulated idealized movement syndromes representing suites of correlated movement traits observed across taxa (migration, nomadism, territoriality, and central place foraging). Two principal components explained 70{\%} of the variance among the movement metrics we evaluated across the thirteen species, and were used for the cluster analysis. The resulting analysis revealed four statistically distinct clusters. All simulated individuals of each idealized movement syndrome organized into separate clusters, suggesting that the four clusters are explained by common movement syndrome. Our results offer early indication of widespread recurrent patterns in movement ecology that have consistent statistical signatures, regardless of taxon, body size, mode of movement, or environment. We further show that a simple set of metrics can be used to classify broad-scale movement patterns in disparate vertebrate taxa. Our comparative approach provides a general framework for quantifying and classifying animal movements, and facilitates new inquiries into relationships between movement syndromes and other ecological processes.},

abstract = {The Wadden Sea is a shallow coastal region, with a large area of sedimentary tidal flats that extends from The Netherlands to Denmark and has been declared a site of international importance in the Dutch and German parts (Ramsar status and {\{}UNESCO{\}} World Heritage Site). Benthic macrofauna are central to the ecosystem functioning of this area, as they recycle nutrients, decompose organic matter and are an important food source for many secondary consumers, like fish and waterbirds. Due to the environmental gradients characteristic of estuarine systems, it is expected that changes in assemblage composition will be observed across the physical and environmental gradients of the Wadden Sea. First, we explored the spatial variation in assemblage composition of benthic macrofauna across the intertidal part of the Dutch Wadden Sea using 3years of biomass data. Then, we identified the relative importance of six environmental variables for explaining and predicting changes in assemblage composition across the intertidal areas of the Wadden Sea using generalised dissimilarity modelling ({\{}GDM{\}}). In accordance with the environmental gradients across this system, the biomass contributed by a few common species differed from west to east and were distinct in the Dollard. In the west, bivalves Mya arenaria, Cerastoderma edule and Ensis directus contributed a relatively large and equal share of the total biomass, whereas C. edule contributed the sole largest share of the total biomass towards the east. The polychaete Alitta succinea became a large share of the total biomass in the upper Ems and in the Dollard estuary, but contributed little elsewhere. Similar to the observed differences in species composition, the spatial patterns in assemblage composition, as predicted by the {\{}GDM{\}} models, identified the Dollard as distinct and that the prevalence of assemblage types in the west differed to the east. Median grain size, followed by microphytobenthic biomass, and exposure time were the most important variables describing differences in assemblage composition. That the Wadden Sea forms a heterogeneous landscape where assemblage composition varies across multiple gradients has repercussions for management and monitoring.},

abstract = {Darwin and the architects of the Modern Synthesis found sympatric speciation difficult to explain and suggested it is unlikely to occur. Increasingly, evidence over the past few decades suggest that sympatric speciation can occur under ecological conditions that require at most intraspecific competition for a structured resource. Here we used an individual-based population model with variable foraging strategies to study the evolution of mating behavior among foraging strategy types. Initially, individuals were placed at random on a structureless resource landscape, with subsequent spatial variation induced through foraging activity itself. The fitness of individuals was determined by their biomass at the end of each generational cycle. The model incorporates three diallelic, codominant foraging strategy genes, and one mate-choice or m-trait (i.e. incipient magic trait) gene, where the latter is inactive when random mating is assumed. Under non-random mating, the m-trait gene promotes increasing levels of either disassortative or assortative mating when the frequency of m respectively increases or decreases from 0.5. Our evolutionary simulations demonstrate that, under initial random mating conditions, an activated m-trait gene evolves to promote assortative mating because the system, in trying to fit a multipeak adaptive landscape, causes heterozygous individuals to be less fit than homozygous individuals. Our results extend our theoretical understanding that sympatric speciation can evolve under nicheless or gradientless resource conditions: i.e. the underlying resource is monomorphic and initially spatially homogeneous. Further the simplicity and generality of our model suggests that sympatric speciation may be more likely than previously thought to occur in mobile, sexually-reproducing organisms.},

abstract = {Continuous human population expansion pressure on conservation ecosystems restricts wildlife areas, and necessitates active management. In areas of changing land-use and increasing human-animal conflict, responses of wildlife to direct human interventions can inform managers and planners. During August 2004, the boundary fences between Phinda Private Game Reserve and two neighbouring reserves were removed. This study examined behavioural responses of the resident elephants. Older, recently introduced bulls moved into the new area during the first month after fence removal, while younger resident bulls and family groups took between five and eight months. Initially family groups only moved into the new area at night and spent minimal time there, while older bulls spent longer periods of time, regardless of time of day. One year after fence removal, most of the elephants had only expanded their home ranges slightly into the new area. One of the findings of this study is that elephants appear to act cautiously in exploring new areas and responded by moving into the area slowly and over a relatively long time period. This cautious behaviour reduced through time as animals became more familiar with the area. The spatial scale of response of the elephants was relatively small, while the temporal scale of response was relatively large. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Elephants occur in landscapes where temperatures can reach 50 °C. Due to their large size they may face physiological problems of dissipating heat during such high temperatures. In spite of this, no one seems to have considered ambient temperature as limiting landscape choices in elephants. We recorded hourly landscape use in free-ranging elephants using GPS collars. We also placed temperature data loggers in each of the landscapes, to obtain corresponding ambient temperatures for each hour. Our results suggest that elephants may select landscapes based on the rate at which temperatures changed and also for shade. We suggest that these selected variables provide a thermal benefit to individuals. As such, we propose that landscape use in elephants may be constrained by their thermal physiological requirements as well as other resources such as food and water. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1.Neutral landscape models (NLMs) simulate landscape patterns based on theoretical distributions and can be used to systematically study the effect of landscape structure on ecological processes. NLMs are commonly used in landscape ecology to enhance the findings of field studies as well as in simulation studies to provide an underlying landscape. However, their creation so far has been limited to software that is platform dependent, does not allow a reproducible workflow or is not embedded in R, the prevailing programming language used by ecologists. 2.Here, we present two complementary R packages NLMR and landscapetools, that allow users to generate and manipulate NLMs in a single environment. They grant the simulation of the widest collection of NLMs found in any single piece of software thus far while allowing for easy manipulation in a self-contained and reproducible workflow. The combination of both packages should stimulate a wider usage of NLMs in ecology. NLMR is a comprehensive collection of algorithms with which to simulate NLMs. landscapetools provides a utility toolbox which facilitates an easy workflow with simulated neutral landscapes and other raster data. 3.We show two example applications that illustrate potential use cases for NLMR and landscapetools: First, an agent-based simulation study in which the effect of spatial structure on disease persistence was studied. The second example shows how increases in spatial scaling can introduce biases in calculated landscape metrics. 4.Simplifying the workflow around generating and handling NLMs should encourage an uptake in the usage of NLMs. NLMR and landscapetools are both generic frameworks that can be used in a variety of applications and are a further step to having a unified simulation environment in R for answering spatial research questions.

abstract = {The historical regulation of African elephant Loxodonta africana populations could provide guidelines for management efforts and decisions in areas where elephant numbers are now increasing. However, there are few detailed records of the natural mortality processes of the past. Therefore, we modelled elephant population growth to evaluate possible effects of age-specific mortality. Model projections indicated that an annual mortality of 17.1{\%} of juveniles or 10.5{\%} of adults would be sufficient to prevent population growth. For age classes below or just at sexual maturity (i.e. 0-3, 4-7, 8-11) 37.5{\%} annual mortality of one of these classes was required to achieve 0{\%} population growth. These mortality levels are much higher than those reported in southern Africa today. Simulations of episodic mortality events (e.g. droughts) indicated that such events would need to occur every 16 years at a severity that would cause the mortality of all infants and weaned calves (0-7 years old), as well as 10{\%} of adults and subadults (8-60 years old) to prevent long-term population growth. An 8-year frequency required the mortality of 84.7{\%} of infants and weaned calves. Historically, it is possible that high drought mortality and frequency, and high predation levels, may have reduced population growth significantly but current mortality rates and frequencies are insufficient to constrain long-term average population growth at 0{\%}. The natural limitation of existent elephant populations through mortality is therefore unlikely, indicating a need for active management of the increasing elephant populations in southern Africa.},

abstract = {Most of southern Africa's elephants inhabit environments where environmental temperatures exceed body temperature, but we do not know how elephants respond to such environments. We evaluated the relationships between apparent thermoregulatory behaviour and environmental, skin and core temperatures for tame savanna elephants (Loxodonta afri-cana) that were free-ranging in the hot parts of the day, in their natural environment. Environmental temperature dictated elephant behaviour within a day, with potential consequences for fine-scale habitat selection, space use and foraging. At black globe temperatures of ∼30°C, elephants adjusted their behaviour to reduce environmental heat load and increase heat dissipation (e.g. shade use, wetting behaviour). Resting, walking and feeding were also influenced by environmental temperature. By relying on behavioural and autonomic adjustments, the elephants maintained homeothermy, even at environmental temperatures exceeding 40°C. Elephants clearly have the capacity to deal with extreme heat, at least in environments with adequate resources of forage, water and shade. Future conservation actions should provide for the thermoregulatory, resource and spatial needs of elephants.},

abstract = {In predator-free large herbivore populations, where density-dependent feedbacks occur at the limit where forage resources can no longer support the population, environmental catastrophes may play a significant role in population regulation. The potential role of fire as a stochastic mass-mortality event limiting these populations is poorly understood, so too the behavioural and physiological responses of the affected animals to this type of large disturbance event. During September 2005, a wildfire resulted in mortality of 29 (18{\%} population mortality) and injury to 18, African elephants in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. We examined movement and herd association patterns of six GPS-collared breeding herds, and evaluated population physiological response through faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (stress) levels. We investigated population size, structure and projected growth rates using a simulation model. After an initial flight response post-fire, severely injured breeding herds reduced daily displacement with increased daily variability, reduced home range size, spent more time in non-tourist areas and associated less with other herds. Uninjured, or less severely injured, breeding herds also shifted into non-tourist areas post-fire, but in contrast, increased displacement rate (both mean and variability), did not adjust home range size and formed larger herds post-fire. Adult cow stress hormone levels increased significantly post-fire, whereas juvenile and adult bull stress levels did not change significantly. Most mortality occurred to the juvenile age class causing a change in post-fire population age structure. Projected population growth rate remained unchanged at 6.5{\%} p.a., and at current fecundity levels, the population would reach its previous level three to four years post-fire. The natural mortality patterns seen in elephant populations during stochastic events, such as droughts, follows that of the classic mortality pattern seen in predator-free large ungulate populations, i.e. mainly involving juveniles. Fire therefore functions in a similar manner to other environmental catastrophes and may be a natural mechanism contributing to population limitation. Welfare concerns of arson fires, burning during "hot-fire" conditions and the conservation implications of fire suppression (i.e. removal of a potential contributing factor to natural population regulation) should be integrated into fire management strategies for conservation areas.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we discuss the links between evolutionary game theory and personality research. Evolutionary game theory is a set of research methods used to investigate the evolution of social behavior, whereas personality research is mainly focused on comprehensively describing individual differences and their correlates. Until recently, these research domains developed independently, and scholars from one domain only scarcely referred to insights obtained in the other domain. This is changing, however, due to two developments. First, models of evolutionary game theory reveal that personality differences may have an adaptive explanation. These models generate new insights into the origins of personality, and some of these models produce novel and testable hypotheses. Second, it is becoming clear that individual differences matter for the course and outcome of evolution. Accordingly, insights from evolutionary game theory (and experiments based on these insights) can be misleading if personality differences are neglected. Here, we review these recent developments, emphasizing both the evolutionary causes and the evolutionary consequences of personality differences. Overall, we argue that the behavioral sciences would profit from a closer integration of mechanistic and functional perspectives.},

abstract = {Elephant movement patterns in relation to surface water demonstrate that they are a water-dependent species. Thus, there has been interest in using surface water management to mitigate problems associated with localized elephant overabundance. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying the elephant's water dependence remain unclear. Although thermoregulation is likely an important driver, the relationship between thermoregulation, water use and climate has not been quantified. We measured skin surface temperature of and cutaneous water loss from 13 elephants (seven African, 3768±642 kg; six Asian, 3834±498 kg) and determined the contribution of evaporative cooling to their thermal and water budgets across a range of air temperatures (8-33°C). We also measured respiratory evaporative water loss and resting metabolic heat production on a subset of elephants (N=7). The rate of cutaneous evaporative water loss ranged between 0.31 and 8.9 g min(-1) m(-2) for Asian elephants and 0.26 and 6.5 g min(-1) m(-2) for African elephants. Simulated thermal and water budgets using climate data from Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and Okaukuejo, Namibia, suggested that the 24-h evaporative cooling water debt incurred in warm climates can be more than 4.5 times that incurred in mesic climates. This study confirms elephants are obligate evaporative coolers but suggests that classification of elephants as water dependent is insufficient given the importance of climate in determining the magnitude of this dependence. These data highlight the potential for a physiological modeling approach to predicting the utility of surface water management for specific populations.},

This often requires to embrace large-scale approaches that extend beyond the borders of formally protected areas. However, the quality of the scientific knowledge about animal movement across large conservation areas vary, and could limit the effectiveness of conservation efforts. Here we used GPS tracking to conduct the first study of large-scale movements of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) in Hwange NP (Zimbabwe), which is an unfenced park part of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, the world's largest terrestrial conservation area. We show that some, but not all, elephants migrate seasonally, with wet- to dry-season movements linked to the provision of water in Hwange NP. The distance between the most distant locations of individual elephants reaches 260 km. In this partial migration system influenced by management practices, over 20{\%} of the elephants have wet-season ranges established in Botswana, outside of protected areas in private or communal wildlife management areas. Our results call for the urgent drafting of a regional action plan, involving all stakeholders identified by our study and their neighbours, to predict and react to what would happen if water provision in Hwange NP was to suddenly change because of management practices or extreme climate change. Beyond this critical conservation issue for the world's largest elephant meta-population, our results also highlight the relevance of large-scale conservation areas combined with integrative planning involving national wildlife management institutions and the private and communal sector.},

abstract = {Sex hormones, reproductive status, and pathogen load all affect stress. Together with stress, these factors can modulate the immune system and affect disease incidence. Thus, it is important to concurrently measure these factors, along with their seasonal fluctuations, to better understand their complex interactions. Using steroid hormone metabolites from fecal samples, we examined seasonal correlations among zebra and springbok stress, reproduction, gastrointestinal (GI) parasite infections, and anthrax infection signatures in zebra and springbok in Etosha National Park (ENP), Namibia, and found strong seasonal effects. Infection intensities of all three GI macroparasites examined (strongyle helminths, Strongyloides helminths, and Eimeria coccidia) were highest in the wet season, concurrent with the timing of anthrax outbreaks. Parasites also declined with increased acquired immune responses. We found hormonal evidence that both mares and ewes are overwhelmingly seasonal breeders in ENP, and that reproductive hormones are correlated with immunosuppression and higher susceptibility to GI parasite infections. Stress hormones largely peak in the dry season, particularly in zebra, when parasite infection intensities are lowest, and are most strongly correlated with host mid-gestation rather than with parasite infection intensity. Given the evidence that GI parasites can cause host pathology, immunomodulation, and immunosuppression, their persistence in ENP hosts without inducing chronic stress responses supports the hypothesis that hosts are tolerant of their parasites. Such tolerance would help to explain the ubiquity of these organisms in ENP herbivores, even in the face of their potential immunomodulatory trade-offs with anti-anthrax immunity.},
